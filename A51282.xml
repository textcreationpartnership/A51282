            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>However he owns, that as to one Branch herein, he had chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to what <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> in his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions</hi> of the <hi>Paſſions</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; which yet being but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mere Speculation, is therefore ſubject to the leſs Exceptions.</p>
            <p>And altho, as to the reſt, his chief intention was, To pour forth the Senſe and Emanations of his own Mind upon this Subject; Yet that he very often, and moſt reſpectfully, had concurr'd with many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients: And had even produc'd their very Words and Sentences, that it might the more appear, how by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and fortifying them with his own, he had not ſo much affected Singularity in this Undertaking, as a reſtitution of Morals to their priſtin State.</p>
            <p>But if, after all, he ſhall be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
<pb facs="tcp:100094:6"/> as over-doing this Matter in too Numerous a Citation of ſuch Ancient Authors; he freely owns that herein alſo, he did purpoſely meditate how to expoſe, to the Eyes of the Chriſtian World, What a holy and ſanctifi'd ſenſe of Virtue even the Heathens had; and how, in their frequent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, they had ſo Divinely expreſs'd it, That we Chriſtians might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to conſider, how few of us either Live ſo well, or Speak ſo wiſely as they did. For (alas) we of this Age, ſcorn to be ſubject, either to the Name or Exerciſe of Virtue! We diſown and vilifie it, as fit only for the more barbarous and unpolliſhed Nations of the World, ſuch as are not enlightned, and whom we think deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably of; while in this very preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption we do not ſo much undervalue their Ignorance, as we diſcover our own. What Rational Creature is
<pb facs="tcp:100094:6"/> there, but muſt acknowledg, That Virtue has a participation with the Divine Nature? And what elſe could make it, as it is, ſo great a part of our Chriſtian Religion? For howbeit thoſe three Names, which among Men ſo often occur, of <hi>Virtue, Grace,</hi> and <hi>the Divine Life,</hi> may ſeem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; Yet, if <hi>rightly</hi> ponder'd, they are all but one and the ſame Thing. For to affirm that the Perfection of Man's Mind makes up the Divine Life, inaſmuch as the Image of God is repreſented in it; This ſurely is no ſlight Notion of Virtue, but rather a ſtrong and comprehenſive Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation thereof. The ſame we might ſay of Grace alſo, as it is God's Munificence towards Man; and of Virtue no leſs, <hi>as it is a powerful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul, whereby the Paſſions are ſo ſubdu'd, as in every Caſe to be able to proſecute that which is the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:100094:7"/> perfect Good.</hi> This is the Definition, the Dr. hath choſen to beſtow on Virtue in his following Tract; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning thereby to rebuke the folly of thoſe Men, who think they can live a Divine Life, without tying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to the Rules of Morality; and who lay aſide Virtue, while they fanatically pretend unto Grace.</p>

                  <p>ETHICKS <hi>are defined to be the Art of Living well and happily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. WE underſtand in this place, by <hi>Art,</hi> a methodical Knowledge of ſuch Precepts as are conſentaneous one to another. And therefore, ſince <hi>Ethicks</hi> are that <hi>Art</hi> we deſign to treat of, our Precepts muſt all partake thereof, and all conduce thereunto; for elſe they would not be <hi>conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous.</hi> So that you are not to expect Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts how to <hi>diſpute,</hi> but how to live, and how to be <hi>happy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſon why in the Definition above we call it, <hi>The Art of Living both well and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100094:10"/> is, becauſe a Man may live <hi>well,</hi> and yet not altogether ſo <hi>happily;</hi> which two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering kinds of Life the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> did rightly diſtinguiſh; for by their Doctrin, it is one thing to be <hi>perfect according to Nature,</hi> another <hi>according to Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. NOW ſuch men, <hi>are by nature perfect,</hi> who are adorned with Virtue. For, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of thoſe Philoſophers, <hi>Virtue is the top and perfection of every Nature.</hi> They term theſe men <hi>good only,</hi> and not happy or bleſt. <hi>But ſuch men are ſaid to be perfect according to life, who are not only good, but alſo happy.</hi> For they define <hi>happineſs</hi> to be the Perfection of human Life; and they define human life to be a Collection or <hi>Chronicle of human Actions.</hi> Wherefore, ſeeing the Event and Succeſs of ſuch Actions depend on Fortune, no man can, without the Benefits of Fortune, enjoy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. THE Definition of <hi>Felicity</hi> given by <hi>Archytas,</hi> is conſonant to what we have ſaid, namely, <hi>That it was the practice of Virtue joyned with good Fortune.</hi> And laſt of all, <hi>Euthephemus</hi> hath well illuſtrated the matter in this threefold Similitude: <hi>Juſt as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>overcomes by Valour and good Succeſs; and as the Pilot gains his Port by true ſteering, and a favourable Gale; and as the Eye beholds by the Power of

Now altho the good Things of Fortune, which we here recommend, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abſolutely be ſaid to be within our Power; yet we preſume to ſay, that foraſmuch as the Precepts, laid down by <hi>Ethicks,</hi>

                  <p n="1">I. ETHICKS are divided into two Parts, <hi>The Knowledge of Happineſs, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of it.</hi> The <hi>Knowledge</hi> contains the Doctrine of its Nature, and of ſuch things as the Nature of Happineſs does, in ſome ſort, either comprehend, or elſe refer unto. Whence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100094:11"/> in this firſt Part we ſhall principally treat of the <hi>Virtues,</hi> and of the <hi>Paſſions:</hi> and in the laſt Part add ſomewhat about the <hi>external Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> of life.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. HAPPINESS <hi>is that pleaſure which the mind takes in from a Senſe of Virtue, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Well-doing; and of conforming in all things to the Rules of both.</hi> Wherefore we ſay, that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Comforts,</hi> or ſome moderate proportion of them, do much conduce to the making happineſs complete. Here we call <hi>Happineſs</hi> a <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of the Mind rather than an <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, ſince all men allow it to be the <hi>beſt and greateſt of human Fruitions.</hi> But as that cannot be the greateſt which is ſubſervient to another, ſo the <hi>Operation</hi> of the mind cannot be ſaid to be its <hi>greateſt good,</hi> ſince it is but in order to <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> And it is upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <note place="margin">

                  <p n="5">V. IN the fifth place it appears, by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s own Definition of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Magn. Moral. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> that <hi>Happineſs</hi> is of the ſame Affinity. For he defines Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be, <hi>A Reſtitution of every Creature from a ſtate imperfect, or preternatural, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its own proper Nature.</hi> Now a true Feeling and Poſſeſſion of Virtue, is alſo the converſion or bringing a man about, from what is contrary to his Nature, to that which is conformable to it. For tho all Depravity be, according to <hi>Triſmegiſtus,</hi> inbred, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural

                        <hi>Marcus Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> yet in Reality the ſame is quite contrary to human Nature. <hi>For</hi> (as the Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> obſerves) <hi>to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature or according to Reaſon, is in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature the ſame thing.</hi> Wherefore all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is repugnant to human Nature. But that Virtue is natural to human Nature, and born as a Twin therewith, is manifeſt, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Man's Soul is a rational Being, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Righteouſneſs or perfect Virtue (as we are told <hi>by Divine Revelation</hi>) is immortal; and that it was Sin only that brought Death into the World. For ſince the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was to have been eternal, this plainly ſhews, that ſuch a ſtate was moſt perfect and moſt natural. And therefore that Reſtitution unto ſuch a State muſt be the moſt intrinſick and peculiar Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. LASTLY, it muſt be agreed, that the Deſires of the Soul fly not to their Object, as it is intelligible, but as it is good or congruous, or grateful, or at leaſt tending to theſe ends; and ſo filling the mind with all the Joys and Pleaſure it can comprehend. Hence it is plain, that ſupreme Happineſs is not barely to be placed in the Intellect; but her proper Seat muſt be called the <hi>Boniform Faculty of the Soul:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide</hi> in this Book, <hi>L.</hi> 3 <hi>c.</hi> 9. § 14, 15, 16.</note> namely, a Faculty of that divine Compoſition, and ſupernatural Texture, as enables us to diſtinguiſh not only what is ſimply and abſolutely the beſt, but to reliſh it, and to have pleaſure in that alone. Which Faculty much reſembles that part of the Will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100094:12"/> which moves towards that which we judge to be abſolutely the beſt, when, as it were with an unquenchable thirſt and affection it is hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on towards ſo pleaſing an Object; and being in poſſeſſion of it, is ſwallowed up in ſatisfaction that cannot be expreſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. HE therefore who acts according to this Faculty, conforms to <hi>the beſt and divineſt thing that is in us.</hi> And this, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> notes, is neceſſary unto Happineſs. <note place="margin">

                     <hi>For whether</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it be the very mind of man, or ſomething elſe that, according to Nature, ſeems to govern and preſide within us, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of what is moſt Lovely and Divine; or whether it be God himſelf that immediately operates; or elſe thoſe Gifts which we derive from above: this is plain, that ſuch inward Working and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Virtue's Law, is that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates true Happineſs.</hi> Here the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſeems doubtful whether it be the <hi>Intellect,</hi> or any other Faculty (which yet bears Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of things <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>divine</hi>) in whoſe Operation true Happineſs does conſiſt. Yet afterwards he takes part with the <hi>Intellect,</hi> and placeth Happineſs in Contemplation. But we preſume to ſay, this can be no <hi>moral</hi> Happineſs; ſince it would be confined to a few ſpeculative Men and Philoſophers, and ſo ſhut out the Bulk of Mankind, who could never be partakers thereof.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. WHEREFORE, we think, Happineſs ſhould be ſeated rather in that <hi>Boniform Faculty</hi> we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100094:13"/> have ſpoke of; ſince it is the moſt elevated and moſt divine Faculty of the Soul, and ſeems to ſupply the ſame place in it, as the eſſential Good of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> is ſaid to do in the Deity. As alſo becauſe the Study and Improvement of it is common to all men. For it is not above the Talent of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to love God, and his Neigbour very heartily. And, if this be done with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Purity of Life, it is the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Happineſs, and the very natural Fruit of this <hi>exalted Faculty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let no man think meanly thereof, ſince we are free to aver, that nothing of greater Benediction can betide us, either in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or in the future life, than ſuch a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Divine Love.</hi> But we ſhall elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſpeak more freely thereof.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. WE do therefore mention in our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Happineſs, <hi>the pleaſure which the mind enjoys from a ſenſe of Virtue;</hi> becauſe there are ſome kinds of allowable pleaſure, ſuch as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>generous,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="9">IX. NOW I affirm this pleaſure to ariſe from a <hi>Senſe of Virtue;</hi> and it is erroneous to think the Fruit of Virtue ſhould conſiſt in ſuch ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary

                  <p n="1">I. VIRTUE <hi>is an intellectual Power of the Soul, by which it over-rules the animal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions or bodily Paſſions; ſo as in every Action it eaſily purſues what is abſolutely and ſimply the beſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it ſeems fit, in the Definition, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. § 3.</note> to call Virtue rather a <hi>Power</hi> than a <hi>Habit.</hi> Firſt, becauſe the word <hi>Virtue</hi> implies as much, and ſignifies the ſame thing as Fortitude. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100094:15"/> next becauſe an <hi>Habit</hi> is not eſſential to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For if a Man had this <hi>intellectual Power</hi> born in him, he would doubtleſs be virtuous, tho it came not to him in the way of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Actions, ſuch as conſtitute a Habit. For it is not the external Cauſes, but the internal, which make the eſſence of a thing. Beſides it is this Idea of Virtue which elevates and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the mind to love her, and tread in her ways, and which argues Virtue to be a quick and vigorous heat, by which the mind is eaſily and irreſiſtibly moved to do things which are good and honorable. So that we eſteem this very Notion of Virtue able to rowze up men from Sloth and Lethargy, and make thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, who on a few moderate Performances think to ſet up for Men of Virtue.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. WE term this a <hi>Power intellectual,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe of its ſituation, which is in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual</hi> part of the Soul (and not in the <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> part of it, where that Power reſides which governs the Members) but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is always excited by ſome Principle which is <hi>intellectual</hi> or rational. By animal <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> we underſtand every motion of the Body, which being obtruded with any ſort of Violence on the Soul, brings danger of Sin and Error, if not carefully watched.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all ſuch Deluſions and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as ſtrongly aſſault the Mind, may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be referred to this Head.

So <hi>Thedges</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> hath it: <hi>That Reaſon doth not beget in us a Continency and Forbearance, but by putting a forcible Reſtraint upon Luſt and Anger. And that when the Paſſions do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and put the ſame forcible reſtraint upon Reaſon, ſhe then gives place to Incontinency and a ſoftneſs of mind which receives all Impreſſions; when as bare Diſpoſitions without ſuch a forcible reſtraint, can only produce imperfect Virtues, and imperfect Vices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Philoſopher makes theſe interchangeable Conflicts, and Diſpoſitions of the Soul, to be but Virtues half perfect, as alſo the Vices but half inveterate.</p>

Now as to God, he already is all-ſufficient, and wants nothing; wherefore we may infer, that whatever choice, or whatever acquiſition of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Gifts we have, which may moſt contribute to annex the Soul to God by contemplation; this ſurely is the beſt, and this the nobleſt Meaſure for all our Deliberations.

                  <p n="1">I. FORASMUCH as no Man has, in my Opinion, more accurately ſummed up, or diſtinctly defined, the ſeveral kinds or ſpecies of Paſſions, than the renowned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Des Cartes;</hi> I will tread, for the moſt part, in his Footſteps, unleſs upon great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the contrary. But it is not amiſs, in the firſt place, to lay down a larger Definition of Paſſions, and to apply the ſame to the kinds thereof, which follow.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. PASSION <hi>then is a vehement Senfation of the Soul, which refers eſpecially to the Soul it ſelf, and is accompanied with an unwonted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, I ſay, <hi>Paſſion</hi> is rightly called <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> ſince in Paſſion the Soul is ſenſible that it ſuffers; and with <hi>Vehemence,</hi> becauſe it vehemently ſuffers. That <hi>the Soul it ſelf</hi> is ſaid, in this Senſation, <hi>eſpecially to ſuffer,</hi> is to diſtinguiſh it from other Senſations; whether of Odors, Sounds and Colors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which refer to external Objects; or of Hunger, Thirſt, and Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which regard our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Next, I ſay, that this Senſation is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <hi>with the Motion of the Spirits,</hi> rather than to ſay that it reſults therefrom; inaſmuch as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100094:33"/> the former evermore happens; but this not always, or very ſeldom, if you but exclude ſuch Motion as reſults from Eating, Drinking, or the Change of Air. For in external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which agitate the Senſe or Imagination, it is the Soul moves the Spirits, and not the Spirits the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">IV. YET after this, when the Soul comes to conſider the <hi>Object</hi> as <hi>grateful</hi> or <hi>ungrateful,</hi> (which is the ſame almoſt as <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi>) then one of them excites <hi>Love,</hi> and the other <hi>Hatred.</hi> But if this <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> be conſidered by us as remote and <hi>future,</hi> they kindle in us <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity;</hi> namely, to join with, and enjoy the <hi>firſt,</hi> and to avoid or repel the <hi>latter.</hi> Both which are by the Schools very properly called <hi>Deſiderium</hi> and <hi>Fuga.</hi> But laſtly, if this Good and Evil be looked upon as <hi>preſent,</hi> the firſt begets <hi>Joy,</hi> and the other <hi>Grief.</hi>

                  <p n="6">VI. HENCE it is plain, that the Scholaſtick Reduction of the Paſſions to the two Heads, of <hi>Iraſcible</hi> and <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi> which the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nion, be juſtly enough referred to thoſe words of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> which anſwer to the Schoolmens <hi>Iraſcible</hi> and <hi>Concupiſcible;</hi> which, in proper Terms are <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> and <hi>Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And this latter <hi>is that Emotion of the Soul, by which it teſtifies wrath againſt every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of what is either evil or ungrateful.</hi> Now if herein there be no conſideration either
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100094:34"/> of <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>future,</hi> then it is <hi>ſimple Hatre;</hi> if the Evil be impending it is <hi>Fight,</hi> or elſe a Cupidity either to reſiſt, or by any expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to evade it: But if it be actually <hi>preſent,</hi> then it is <hi>Sorrow, Grief,</hi> or <hi>Sickneſs of the Mind;</hi> which is nothing elſe but Indignation to ſuffer, and to ſtoop under the Tyranny of an Evil, which cannot be ſhaken off.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. THE Reaſon of <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> is the ſame: which if it be fairly accompanied with the appearance of what is good or grateful, and nothing of Time reſpected, it is called pure and <hi>ſimple Love.</hi> If the Good be looked on as <hi>future,</hi> it is <hi>Cupidity,</hi> or elſe <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence</hi> properly ſo called; but if it be <hi>preſent,</hi> then it is <hi>Joy</hi> or <hi>Gladneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet we muſt think that it ceaſeth to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.</hi> For unleſs ſomewhat that is nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and over-cloying ſupervenes, the Love we mention is naturally prone to a continuation in its own Eſtate; ſo as ſome Ingredient of Concupiſcence will ſtill remain.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. WHEREFORE it is poſſible there may only be two principal and primitive Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which have their proper Reſidence in the <hi>Heart.</hi> They are called by <hi>Des Cartes Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred;</hi> by the Schools <hi>Iraſcible</hi> and <hi>Concupiſcible:</hi> and by <hi>Pythagoras, Luſt</hi> and <hi>Anger;</hi> which is ſomewhat remarkable, as from the Uſe thereof we may have cauſe to note.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. HOWEVER, at preſent, and for a more extended Notion of the Paſſions, I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100094:34"/> will follow <hi>Des Cartes</hi> in his own Order and Diſtinction, as to the ſix general kinds above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. I will therefore firſt define them, and then ſubjoin the reſpective Species unto each.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Admiration</hi> is the firſt; <note place="margin">The firſt Rank of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                     <hi>And it is a Paſſion of the Soul, which is ſtruck with the Novelty of any Object, and attentively ingaged in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiton thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Admiration</hi> is twofold; the one of <hi>Eſteem,</hi> the other of <hi>Deſpiſing. Eſteem is the admiring of the Magnitude or Value of any Object. But Deſpiſing is a contrary Admiration at the Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Deſpicableneſs of any Object.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence 'tis underſtood what is <hi>Eſteem,</hi> or <hi>Diſeſteem of a Man's ſelf;</hi> Namely, <hi>when a Man dwells affectedly in the Contemplation of his own Dignity, or is fixed with ſome Reſentment on his own Meanneſs or Diſgrace.</hi> The <hi>Reaſon</hi> is the ſame either as to <hi>Diſeſteem,</hi> or elſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi> for others: The firſt of which is called <hi>Scorning,</hi> and the laſt <hi>Veneration.</hi> Now <hi>Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is the Value we ſet upon a free Agent, that can, as we believe, do us either good or harm; and joined with a deſire we have of putting our ſelves in ſubjection to it. But <hi>Scorn</hi> is a diſeſteem we put upon a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, which tho capable of doing us either good or hurt, yet we judge ſo meanly of ſuch Agent, as not to be able to put in execution either the one or the other.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. IN the ſecond Rank come <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Love is a Paſſion of the Soul, <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Rank of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> by which it is excited willingly to join it ſelf unto Objects which ſeem grateful thereunto.</hi> Yet here by the words. <hi>To join it ſelf willingly,</hi> is not meant to <hi>covet</hi> its being joined; for that appertains to <hi>Luſt:</hi> but it is meant with ſome emotion to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the thing to be either good or grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hatred is a Paſſion of the Soul, whereby it is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted willingly to ſeparate it ſelf from Objects which ſeem ingrateful or hurtful thereunto.</hi> When he that loves, eſteems the Object leſſer than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it is called ſimple Inclination, or <hi>good Will;</hi> where equal to himſelf, then is it <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> and where greater, then <hi>Devotion. Love</hi> which tends ſingly towards good things, is called <hi>Love;</hi> when towards beautiful things, then <hi>Complacency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Hatred,</hi> which refers ſimply to evil things, is called <hi>Hatred;</hi> if to deformed things, then <hi>Averſion</hi> or <hi>Horror.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor ought we here to forget that noble and natural ſort of <hi>Love,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> termed <hi>Storge,</hi> and which we may call <hi>natural Affection;</hi> or that of <hi>Hatred,</hi> called <hi>Antipathy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">XI. <note place="margin">The third Rank of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> THE third Claſſis is <hi>Cupidity,</hi> with all its Tribe or Off-ſpring.</p>

                     <hi>Cupidity is a Paſſion of the Soul, by which it is carried towards good as it is future.</hi> And therefore as the Abſence of Evil, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Good, are both of them good, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity</hi> may ſo far extend to either as they are future. But if any man thinks it more proper,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100094:35"/> that <hi>Cupidity</hi> about the laſt Object ſhould be called <hi>Deſire,</hi> and about the firſt <hi>Flight,</hi> I am indifferent. Only this is plain, from what is gone before, that among the ſorts of <hi>Cupidity,</hi> thoſe of them excel which ſpring up either from <hi>Horror,</hi> or from <hi>Complacency.</hi> For nothing kindles Deſire ſo much as Pulchritude or <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and nothing puts ſooner to flight, than any horrid <hi>Deformity.</hi> And the thing which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is thought moſt horrible, is <hi>Death.</hi>

                  <p n="1">I. AS to what concerns the <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Uſes</hi> of the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> it will not be amiſs to purſue them a little larger, and faithfully to interpret the Voice of Nature in them all, as far as we are able. For it is not of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards knowing how Paſſions are rightly to be moderated and uſed (which ſurely in Virtue is the greateſt part) if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the end unto which Nature, or rather God, who is the Parent of Nature, has deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned each of them: as alſo at what Rate he himſelf eſteems his Works, <note place="margin">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100094:38"/> Speculation; nor are they to be acquired by Methods, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. § 6.</note> but are really in us antecedent to all Notion and Cogitation whatever. For they are, by God, whom we call Nature's Parent, given and implanted in us, as early as Life it ſelf: ſuch I mean, as are in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the pleaſure of Eating and Drinking; which Nature, doubtleſs, beſtowed upon all living Creatures, not only for the Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, and Continuance of Health, but as a grateful Exerciſe of the Faculties of Life. Whence it clearly follows, that nothing ſhould raſhly or cauſeleſly be killed; nor ſhould we ſo far indulge the Pleaſure of Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking, as to loſe the end of that Pleaſure, and bring upon our ſelves Diſeaſes and Death.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. AND this is the very thing the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> adviſed; Namely, <hi>To terminate what is undetermined.</hi> For what they called <hi>undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> or <hi>unbounded,</hi> they placed in the Paſſions; and it was in Vertue and Reaſon that they placed their <hi>Boundaries</hi> or <hi>Determination.</hi> Thus Nature has been the more liberal in beſtowing ſuch ſort of Affections on us, that Reaſon might be truſted with a Power to leſſen, <note place="margin">

And perhaps the Soul, it ſelf, is not ſo wholly intent on her proper intellectual Pleaſure, as totally to neglect the animal Life. From whence we ſee, it is a kind of ſerious and ſettled deſign of Nature, that this animal Station ſhould never be abandoned by the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100094:39"/> Mind of Man. However theſe Touches are but here by the By, as to thoſe Affectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> which relate to the Body. Wherefore we ſhall turn back to the Paſſions properly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> that order which we before propoſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. FIRST then as to <hi>Admiration,</hi> 'tis plain, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. § 11.</note> that it more vigorouſly imprints in our Memories the obſervation of new things and <hi>Idea's;</hi> whereby, the Soul being enriched by ſuch Acquiſition, we may attain the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of moſt Beneficial Truths. And hence it follows, that if any Man be taken up with the Contemplation of new Things, for no other end than for Admiration-ſake; he plainly loſes the end of this Paſſion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a mere <hi>Admirer.</hi> For ſeeing Nature has given us the Power and Inclination to <hi>eſteem,</hi> or to <hi>deſpiſe;</hi> it appears thereby that all things are not to be placed by us in the ſame <hi>Rank.</hi> And as in the kinds of every thing, there is a <hi>better</hi> and a <hi>worſe:</hi> ſo certainly is there ſomething which is the very <hi>beſt</hi> of all; and which by the Dictates of Nature, we are bound to <hi>aſpire</hi> unto.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. THE <hi>Eſteem of a Man's ſelf is a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, mixed of Admiration, Joy, and Love, of his own Condition:</hi> But <hi>the Diſeſteem of a Man's ſelf is from Admiration, Grief, and Self-love, which is mixed with Hatred for his own Defects.</hi> Each of theſe Paſſions make out, that every Man either is, or ought to be, of ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; nay, ſo to be reputed of, as to be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100094:39"/> above all Injury and Contempt. For ſeeing we are ſo eaſily led to think well of our ſelves, when perhaps we have very ſmall <hi>Advantage</hi> of our <hi>Neighbors;</hi> certainly it is but juſt that we carry ſome Eſteem alſo towards others, ſo as to treat them with all Officiouſneſs and Candor. Wherefore even <hi>Nature</hi> points out, by theſe Paſſions of <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Diſeſteem,</hi> how we are to exerciſe Humanity and <hi>good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> towards others; as well as Diligence and Application in getting what is moſt beneficial to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. As to that ſort of valuing a Man's ſelf, which <hi>Des Cartes</hi> calls <hi>Generoſity,</hi> whereby a Man does, in the Freedom and Sincerity of his Judgment, ſo account of himſelf as, while he ſteadily aims at vertuous things, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. § 10.</note> and wants no Courage to enterprize what Reaſon dictates, he will endure no ſort of Contempt. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Uſe of this Paſſion (ſo implanted by Nature) is of higheſt Preheminence, as it proves a Spur to the procurement of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Felicity. For who can be more corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt the Scorns of Men, or the Shocks of Fortune, than he who has Conſcience on his ſide, that his Actions have been ſincere.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. VENERATION is a Paſſion compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi> The Utility thereof is referable to Politick Bodies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Societies: it implies that Obedience is due to Magiſtrates; and that there is ſuch a Being as God, and ſuch a Government as the Divine Providence.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:100094:40"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſdaining</hi> is made up of <hi>Admiration,</hi> and of <hi>Security,</hi> or <hi>Confidence.</hi> This Paſſion is not altogether unprofitable to the Peace and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence of the Mind, inaſmuch as it ſuffers not Virtue or Truth to be abandoned, either on the Threats, or on the Temptations of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Men. Such was the Contempt of <hi>Socrates</hi> towards <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Melitus,</hi> when he let them know, <hi>That altho they had Power to kill, they had not the Power to hurt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. FOR what concerns the five follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Primitive Paſſions,</hi> as <hi>Love, Hatred, Joy, Grief,</hi> and <hi>Cupidity.</hi> The Uſe of theſe is moſt manifeſt. And the firſt four end always in the Fifth; for whatever falls out grateful, excites Joy or Pleaſure; and Pleaſure, when felt, draws Love towards that which excited it: And, laſt of all, <hi>Love</hi> makes <hi>Cupidity,</hi> for the increaſing, continuing, and ſometimes repeating, of the ſame Delight.</p>
                  <p>'Tis in like ſort, when any thing happens that is ungrateful, it begets <hi>Sadneſs</hi> and <hi>Grief;</hi> and this <hi>Grief</hi> again begets <hi>Hatred</hi> for that which was the Cauſe thereof; and that <hi>Hatred</hi> a <hi>Cupidity</hi> to get free from ſuch Cauſe. And 'tis in theſe things alone that the Safety and Preſervation of all living Creatures does in a manner conſiſt. Alſo 'tis worthy of Note, that theſe Paſſions which are the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, ſuch as <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi> do not perform leſs of this Duty than the moſt <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> for that our Life is no leſs haraſſed by the Evils that lie upon us, than from the Want
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100094:40"/> of thoſe Benefits which ſhould advantage us.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. IT is plain, that Nature ſeems more ſolicitous to drive away Evil, than to partake of Pleaſure. And this appears in thoſe effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſorts of Eloquence, ſhe has beſtowed on ſo many of the Creatures when they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, for the drawing of Compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. Such is the querulous and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting tone of the Voice, the dejection of the Eyes and Countenance, Groaning, Howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sighs, and Tears, and the like. For all theſe have Power to incline the Mind to Compaſſion, whether it be to quicken out Help, or to retard the Miſchiefs we intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. NOR is Nature wanting altogether in that part, which concerns the procuring of Pleaſure. For every motion of the Eyes and Countenance, when we are pleaſed, is much more welcome and agreeable to the Lookers on: And even this ſmall Effect of our Joy is by Nature inſtituted, as a Bait or Allurement, to draw on mutual Complacency, and to create a deſire towards the Contentation of each other. Juſt as thoſe former Effects of Sorrow were to dehort us from afflicting any, who deſerved it not, but rather to melt us, and puſh us on, to a timely ſuccor of all who are oppreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as exceſſive Joy does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring on what they call <hi>Extaſie,</hi> and even ſwooning away: I know not if
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100094:41"/> Nature does not hint hereby, that our Souls are capable of greater Pleaſure, as well as Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than our preſent corporeal and terreſtrial State can bear, or is able to ſupport.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred, Grief</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of them is this, That we do, as much as in us lies, purchaſe Good to our ſelves and others; Next, that we hurt no Man, but on the contrary drive away Evil moſt induſtriouſly and affectionately from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as well as our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. ALL Diligence is animated by <hi>Cupidity,</hi> which is the moſt <hi>Mercurial</hi> and awakened Paſſion, and which agitates the Heart with more violence than any other Affection. It ſends up a greater quantity of Spirits to the Brain, which diffuſing themſelves again into the Members of the Body; not only render it more active and more vigorous, but the Soul alſo is hereby drawn in, and concurs in a grateful and chearful Vivacity. For the Soul, if it want ſuitable Entertainment or Objects that are worthy of it, is but too apt to ruſt, and grow <hi>Lethargick;</hi> even as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> has ſomewhere truly admoniſhed, <hi>That the Life of Man, without a propoſed End, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether looſe or languiſhing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However if we would rightly govern, and make uſe of, this <hi>Cupidity</hi> to good purpoſe; let us beware, that it fly not to Objects that are without our reach, or more impetuouſly to thoſe within it, than our Health and the Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Condition can bear. For to make
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100094:41"/> more haſt after things within our Power, than will conſiſt with our Strength or Ability, is but attempting things that are plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. So that ſuch unadviſed <hi>Cupidity</hi> would end rather in Sorrow and Vexation, than in Contentment.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſince 'tis ſo manifeſt, what the end of <hi>Cupidity</hi> is; Namely, to excite Vigor in the Execution of our Purpoſes: this Paſſion muſt wholly be laid by, till we are juſt on the Borders of acting what by Counſel we have reſolved. For elſe this Ardor (and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in weak Conſtitutions) would not only be uſeleſs, but by inflaming the Spirits, would exhauſt our ſtrength, dry the whole Body, and overthrow our Health.</p>

HOW unadviſed therefore have ſome been to ſay, <hi>every thing was lawful, that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did perſuade;</hi> and to ſtyle this a ſort of Divine and Intellectual Document, and while taken abſtractedly, and in the general to contend for it, as a very principal Rule of human Actions: whereas none, but ſuch as are mere Slaves unto Paſſion, can ever think at this Rate. This has been hatched under the Wings of Appetite, not of Reaſon: For to eſtabliſh ſuch a Doctrine of human Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as muſt ſubvert all Actions, is quite irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:100094:51"/>
                  <p n="5">V. WOULD it not from ſuch a Principle follow, that every Man might, at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not only fire his own Houſe in the Night, but the Town alſo? Might he not poiſon the common Well, or maim and deſtroy his Wife and Children, if it were lawful to ſacrifice to his own Paſſion? So that this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being againſt Nature, and utterly perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, it plainly follows, that no Man's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Inclinations are the Meaſures of Good and Evil; but that the Inclinations themſelves are to be circumſcribed by ſome Principle which is ſuperior to them.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. NOW the next Principle, unto which Paſſion is ſubjected, and which knows what in every Caſe is good and bad, is <hi>right Reaſon:</hi> And therefore that which to Right Reaſon appears good or bad, ought certainly to be reputed as ſuch in its own Nature. For what a rectified Mind takes in, is really the Eſſence of the thing it ſelf, painted in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: and ſo a Triangle, in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is nothing elſe but what Right Reaſon conceives to be ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. HENCE it plainly follows, that there are ſome unchangeable Ideas or Impreſſions of Good and Evil, even as of Figures in the Mathematicks; and that the Mind judges of thoſe, as much as Senſe does of theſe: Yet Reaſon and the Intellect have Juriſdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver both. For as thoſe are made up by the Concurrence of ſeveral Lines; ſo are theſe made up of various and often contrary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100094:52"/> which therefore denominate ſome things to be Good, and ſome things to be Evil. And this confirms what has been ſaid, that the Principle, whereby to judge what is either morally good or evil, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Principle, and in ſome ſort Divine.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. THIS hinders not, but that we muſt allow there is ſomething alſo, <note place="margin">

And if this one point be but granted (which no reaſonable Man will deny) you will preſently find number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Inſtances of thoſe things, which in their own Nature may be termed juſt or unjuſt, vile or honeſt; which, by reflecting on thoſe principal ſigns of the Paſſions already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, will occur unto you.

                  <p n="1">I. FOR what concerns the Reſidue of <hi>Corporeal Impreſſions,</hi> the kinds thereof may, in a manner, be referred to theſe two Claſſes. Namely, to
<list>
                        <item>1. Senſation, Imagination, the particular Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Body, and to Cuſtom.</item>
                        <item>2. Or to Education, to a ſingular Genius, or to a particular Fancy.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Impreſſions of the <hi>firſt Claſſis</hi> agree in this, that they appear without any <hi>Appetite</hi> properly ſo called. But thoſe of the ſecond are attended with ſome <hi>proper Appetite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Senſation</hi> is here meant, not the very <hi>Act of Feeling,</hi> which is the true meaning of the Word; but rather a <hi>Stain,</hi> or that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Byaſs</hi> and <hi>Propenſity to error,</hi> which it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints on the Soul. And ſo almoſt of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. WHEREFORE <hi>Senſation</hi> is defin'd, <hi>To be a certain corporeal Impreſſion, by which the Soul is prevailed on to believe, that things are ſuch in their own Natures, as they appear to our external Senſes.</hi> As if a man, finding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that was grateful to his own Taſte,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100094:53"/> ſhould ſtreight conclude, that the ſame Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Sweetneſs were in the thing it ſelf; and therefore that it muſt equally gratifie the Taſte of all other Creatures. We ſee the ſame Fallacy obtruded in the Objects of Sight; when a Man ſhall conclude, that the Light and Colors, which are taken in by the Eye, are alſo in the things themſelves: which is no more true than that Stones feel pain, which wound the bare Feet of thoſe that run over them; or that, when a Man's Hand is burnt by a Coal, that the Coal alſo ſhould have ſenſe of ſuch Burning. For 'tis plain, that <hi>Heat</hi> is no more in the Coal, or in any ſuch Subject, than us the very Pain; but both ariſe from the <hi>Agitation</hi> and <hi>Concuſſion of Particles:</hi> So as if this be very moderate, we feel Heat without any Pain; whereas if our Senſes are immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ſtruck, then follows Perception both of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Pain</hi> together. Wherefore Heat and Pain are things which differ only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; and we our ſelves are the Subject in which they meet, and wherein their Force and Vigor is exerted. And the like we may pronounce of other the Objects of our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. IMAGINATION <hi>is a corporeal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which inclines the Soul to believe, that ſuch things are, or elſe may be; which yet never are, nor can ever be.</hi>

                     </hi> alſo called <hi>quick and perfect Senſation;</hi> ſaying, <hi>There was a ſort of Feeling in our practical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, by which it came to paſs that we were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceived in the ſenſe of what we ſuffered, nor impos'd on by ill reaſoning in what we were to act.</hi>

                  <p>Thus therefore, by ſubjecting of our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the purifying of our Bodies and Souls, there ſprings up to us, as it were, a new <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi> in the Mind or Spirit, which is only the Portion of the <hi>prudent Man.</hi> For in the Power thereof he finds out, and aſcertains that <hi>Golden Mean</hi> which we have hitherto ſo recommended.

                  <p n="6">VI. LASTLY, the <hi>limiting and defining of Right Reaſon</hi> is every where left, by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to the <hi>prudent Man's</hi> Determination. For whenever the Queſtion is ſtarted by him, what this Right Reaſon ſhould be; he ever refers it thus, <hi>Prout vir prudens definiverit; 'Tis
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100094:62"/> even what a prudent Man ſhall judge fit.</hi> And ſurely this is not ſaid in vain, if but applied to the Man we ſpeak of. For how can there be <hi>Right Reaſon</hi> at all, if not found within the reach of that Prudence which already we have defin'd? And therefore if neither the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, have taken much care in the defining of <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> 'tis becauſe they finally referr'd it to the Arbitrement of this our Rectified and Prudent Man. For they all preſum'd that the Mind of Man, when effectually purg'd from the Stains of Prejudice and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, did as naturally diſcern of things which were juſt and true, as an unblemiſh'd Eye does rightfully diſtinguiſh of Colors. So that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was well adviſed in pronouncing <hi>Right Reaſon to be that which was conformable to Prudence;</hi>

                        <hi>Ethic. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> taking <hi>Prudence</hi> in that Latitude we have already ſet forth.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. FROM all that is now ſaid, two things deſerve Obſervation. Firſt, how haughtily, and yet very impertinently, do ſome Men carry it, who while they are deſtitute of all Capacity to judge (as being unacquainted with this <hi>Moral Prudence</hi>) yet are they ſo far from ſubſcribing to what the wiſe and prudent Men, of all Ages, and of every Nation, have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for true and juſt, that they impudently contend there is nothing in its own Nature is either the one or the other, nothing right and nothing wrong. But ſurely, this is not leſs abſurd, than if a blind Man ſhould deny all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100094:62"/> diſtinction of Colors, when he ought rather to enquire before all other things, what were good for his Eyes.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. NEXT we may note, that <hi>Prudence</hi> is not any particular Science of external things, but rather ſomewhat above all Science.

And this is the Gift and Excellency which is peculiar unto <hi>Prudence,</hi> and which attends her in all her ways. But as to the knowledge and ſenſe of things, all this and what appertains thereto we derive it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fountains; as either from Experience, or Natural Philoſophy, or from Skill in War, or in the Laws, and the like.

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the other two Primitive Virtues, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and Patience.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. SINCERITY <hi>is a Virtue of the Soul, by which the Will is intirely and ſincerely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to that which the Mind judgeth to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and ſimply the beſt.</hi> When I ſay <hi>intirely</hi> and <hi>ſincerely,</hi> I mean <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>adequately.</hi> For what is done <hi>perfectly</hi> is (according to <hi>Antoninus</hi>) <hi>done with the whole Soul, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 12. § 29.</note> as well in acting justly, as in ſpeaking of truth.</hi> And the Meaning of <hi>Adequate</hi> is that no By-conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether of Profit or of Fame, muſt ever incline us. For the Soul ought ſo to be temper'd and inflam'd to that which is ſimply the beſt, as neither from Hurt or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny to be diverted from it. <hi>For to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in a good Cauſe, is better than baſe Exemption.</hi> As <hi>Tully</hi> does aſſert.</p>
                  <p>The Nature of this Virtue is explain'd in <hi>Noema</hi> the third, fourth, fifth, and ſo on to the thirteenth: But the true Beauty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof can hardly enter into the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of any Man, who is not already affected and acquainted with it. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. § 9.</note> And 'tis to a Soul thus rectified, that we may apply that of <hi>Ariſtotle, That neither the Evening or the Morning Star is half ſo charming.</hi> There can
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100094:63"/> be no exterior Light half ſo bright, or ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, as this of the Soul, which is pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, and perfect, and even Divine.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. To this State of <hi>Simplicity</hi> or <hi>Sincerity</hi> in the <hi>Soul,</hi> is referable that of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> where he thus expoſtulates with himſelf—<hi>O my beloved Soul, when wilt thou be naked, ſimple, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 10. § 1.</note> and entirely one?</hi> And again he gives himſelf the Rule,—<hi>Do not diſcompoſe thy Mind, or excite the Dregs; <note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 4. § 26.</note> but purifie thy ſelf to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that is poſſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this <hi>Sincerity</hi> is a Fountain that runs clear, and is perennial; it pours in Conſolation, and fills the Life with internal Joy. This is the ſtate of that Peace, which is ſo conſtant and ineffable, that no Cares, no Croſſes, or ſo much as Jealouſies, can diſtract it. For in that which is ſingle, and but one, there can be no. Diverſity: 'tis all Union, profound Love, and perfect Reſt. Wherefore it was not without cauſe, that the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> call'd thoſe bleſſed, who could by this happy <hi>Analyſis, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trept, c.</hi> 4.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all things into one and the ſame Principle;</hi> which they plainly mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to be the Unity of God: and did accordingly bind themſelves <hi>both to follow and to obey him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. BUT to <hi>follow God</hi> conſtantly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, is to follow that which is eminently the beſt; tho not that which is moſt grateful to our Appetites. For who, as a mere Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can ſincerely and conſtantly proſecute that which is beſt? This muſt be the Gift of God, and the Effect of a Divine Senſe or
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100094:64"/> Spirit. That Perfection does not originally appertain to any created Being, but to God the Creator: He, who is the common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us all, and the Legiſlator of the whole World: He, whom <hi>Zeno</hi> in <hi>Laertius</hi> ſtyles, <hi>Right Reaſon penetrating all things; even the ſame Reaſon which is in</hi> Jove <hi>himſelf, the Captain and chief Pilot in the Adminiſtration of the Univerſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 8. § 54.</note> HERETO refers that Exhortation of <hi>Antoninus, That we ſhould not any longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex our ſelves barely about the circumambient Air; but rather join and combine with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Power, which comprehends the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</hi> Which ſaying amounts to this, <hi>That we ought to be drawn into one and the ſame mind with God.</hi> This is the Paſſion that can only make a Man Divine; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tuſculan. Quaeſt. l.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>For ſuch the Man is, as his Affections and Inclinations make him.</hi> 'Tis not here enough to have ſimple Intellection; no, it rather calls up and ſummons the <hi>Boniform Faculty,</hi> which is repleniſh'd with that Divine Senſe and Reliſh, which affords the higheſt Pleaſure, the chiefeſt Beauty, and the utmoſt Perfection to the Soul. 'Tis by this ſupreme Faculty that we pant after God, that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto him, and that (as far as our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does admit) we are even like unto him: he, who is Goodneſs it ſelf, perfect Purity, and the moſt exalted Simplicity; he is that pattern whom in theſe Attributes we are to imitate; and this is that ſtate of <hi>Sincerity</hi> we are to aſpire to, as far as Humanity will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100094:64"/> And as in doing hereof the higheſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Man's Will is beſt expreſs'd; ſo in the ſtate of <hi>Patience</hi> is there exerciſed that great Faculty, which the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> have ſtyled, <hi>The Strength and Bulwark of the Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. PATIENCE <hi>is a Vertue of the Soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 'tis enabled, for the ſake of that which is ſimply and abſolutely the beſt, to undergo all things; even that which, to the animal Nature, is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally harſh and ungrateful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We do not by <hi>Patience</hi> underſtand a bare paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſtupid Indolence; but a vigorous and poſitive Firmity of the Mind: ſuch as was before noted from <hi>Metopus</hi> the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean; And ſuch as ſhrinks not from rugged and dangerous occaſions,</hi> but bears up boldly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly againſt all; ſo as 'tis not in the power of any Mortification whatever to turn the Will from the purſuit of that which is beſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. OF <hi>Patience</hi> there are two Parts or Species, which are <hi>Continence,</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> We mean hereby, not thoſe <hi>Demi Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> which are ſpoken of in the Schools of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but Virtues that are complete. <hi>Continence therefore is that part or ſpecies of Patience, whereby the Soul does, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that which is ſimply the beſt, both eaſily and conſtantly endure whatever Grief or Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation can ariſe by denying the ſenſual Appetite thoſe things, which would otherwiſe be grateful to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suffering is that ſpecies or part of Patience, whereby the Soul does in like manner, for the ſake
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100094:65"/> of that which is ſimply and abſolutely the beſt, both eaſily and conſtantly endure whatever is harſh and vexatious unto our natural Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. THE Demonſtration of theſe Virtues will be found in the <hi>Noemas,</hi> fifth, ſixth, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh: But the uſe of them is of ſuch extent, as to reach to almoſt all Virtues. Wherefore <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> every where ſpeaks to the ſame effect, ſaying, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ethic. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Magn. Moral. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>That all Moral Virtue has reference ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pleaſure or to pain; that 'tis for pleaſure we commit what is vile, and for fear of pain withdraw our ſelves from things that are honeſt.</hi> So that <hi>Epictetus</hi> thought all Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy was ſumm'd up in this ſhort Precept, <hi>Suſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne &amp; abſtine:</hi> As one part thereof referr'd to <hi>Suffering,</hi> the other to <hi>Continence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. HENCE it appears that <hi>Continence,</hi> and <hi>Suffering,</hi> are not barely Virtues, but ſuch as are of a high account. For they both, in their Derivation, have reference to that <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> which is in the <hi>Soul,</hi> either to excite motion, or procure its reſt. And to this Faculty refers what <hi>Antoninus</hi> adviſeth, <hi>That we cleanſe the Imagination, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 7. § 29.</note> and ſtop all Motions of the Senſe.</hi> Which takes in both the Duty of <hi>Continence,</hi> and of <hi>Suffering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">IX. BUT altho we have here ſaid enough of the <hi>Primitive Virtues;</hi> yet we may further inculcate, that they are ſo much the true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Patriarchs of all the reſt, that in them alone all the Force and Eſſence of every other Virtue ſeems to be comprehended. Nor can any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100094:65"/> Man, that is poſſeſſed of theſe, find difficulty in acquiring the reſt. This we chuſe to notifie leſt the Mind ſhould be diſtracted after many things, when theſe very few Objects are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient not only for its Exerciſe, but to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the moſt zealous ſearch and anxiety after Virtue, and for attaining that Felicity which alone can attend it.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. WE only add, that 'tis impoſſible, if a Man wants theſe, he ſhould have any Real Virtue, whatever he may ſhew of what is counterfeit or caſual. For Virtue muſt not be incumbred with Error, nor can it live but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Regency of that <hi>Prudence</hi> we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed. Yet if a Man ſhall by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and without that Prudence, light upon the doing of ſome brave Action, 'tis not Virtue, but Fortune, that muſt be applauded for ſuch happy chance.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Nor can <hi>Sincerity,</hi> or <hi>Simplicity,</hi> be wanting unto Virtue: For without theſe, 'tis not Virtue, but a ſhadow and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Image thereof. And therefore if it ſhall appear even in things well done, that they ſcarce had either been begun or perfected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome extrinſecal and adventitious end; 'tis plain, thoſe events, how proſperous ſoever, loſe both the Name and Nature of <hi>Virtues.</hi> For this was not the proſecuting what was abſolutely and ſimply the beſt; but that which to the Man himſelf, and to his Appetite, was moſt inviting. This is not Virtue's Office, but the Contrivance or Heat of ſome animal
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100094:66"/> Deſign. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Offic. l.</hi> 1.</note> 'Tis what is true, ſimple, and ſincere is unto human Nature, as well as to Right Reaſon, moſt agreeable. Which, as <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Offices</hi> hath explain'd.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. BUT laſtly, as for <hi>Patience,</hi> a good Man can leſs be without it than any of the reſt: ſince there can be no ſecurity of the reſt without this. For how can the effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Man, the ambitious, or he that is a meer Slave to his Appetite, be faithful either to his Prince, his Country, Religion, Friend, or himſelf. No, he will abandon God above, he will betray all if a Storm ariſe, and to exempt himſelf from the Difficulties that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright him, he will not ſcruple to expoſe and ſell Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Monſters and reproach of their Race, Men that know not Friendſhip or Juſtice, or have any ſenſe of human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Offic. l.</hi> 2.</note> For the ſame <hi>Tully</hi> affirms, <hi>That no man can be juſt, who fears Death, Pain, Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Want; or who prefers before Juſtice the things which are contrary to theſe Evils.</hi> Of ſuch Power is <hi>Patience</hi> for the ſupport and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Honeſty.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. THE ſame excellent Philoſopher, as well as Orator, refers to the like Points, when again, in his <hi>Offices,</hi> he ſays,—<hi>That to think meanly of thoſe things which others exalt, and even to ſpurn at them upon a ſteady and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account, was the part of a great Mind. And, on the other ſide, to bear patiently things that are calamitons, ſo as not to loſe the Decorum
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100094:66"/> of Nature, or the Dignity of a wiſe Man, was the Mark of a generous Soul, and of an unſhaken Mind.</hi> The firſt part of this Sentence points towards <hi>Continence,</hi> and the latter to <hi>Suffering.</hi> But he adds at laſt—<hi>That to ſee a Man bid defiance to all Fears, yet be melted down by his own Deſires; to ſee him invincible againſt all Labor, and yet to be overcome with his Luſts: this was a moſt deplorable ſtate.</hi> In this alſo we have a more plain intimation of thoſe two Branches of <hi>Patience,</hi> namely, <hi>Continence</hi> and <hi>Suffering.</hi> And let this in ſhort be ſufficient for the three <hi>Primitive Virtues.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Of Juſtice in general: which is the firſt of the three principal Virtues, which are term'd Derivative.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. THE <hi>principal Derivative</hi> Virtues are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo three, as <hi>Juſtice, Fortitude, and Temperance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juſtice</hi> is well defin'd, by the Lawyers, to be, <hi>Conſtans &amp; perpetua Voluntas ſuum cuique tribuendi, A conſtant and perpetual Will to give every man his own.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ethic. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> And to this Senſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo conforms. So that this Virtue looks chiefly abroad, and is therefore properly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame Philoſopher, <hi>The Good of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:100094:67"/> and eſpecially if you regard that Branch of it which comprehends our Duty towards our Neighbor. But there is a part hereof, which takes in what we owe to God; altho we are as unable to advantage him by our Offerings, as we are to diminiſh or damnifie his bleſſed State by our Demerits. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Juſtice are to be found in <hi>Noema</hi> the thirteenth, fourteenth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on to the twenty third.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. THAT which, in this <hi>Definition,</hi> is called <hi>Suum,</hi> or a <hi>Man's own;</hi> is alſo frequently termed by the Lawyers, <hi>Jus</hi> or <hi>Right:</hi> and they ſay every thing is truly ſo ſtyled, which by a ſort of Fit, and congruous Habitude (that is, by Cuſtom, Sanction, or Conſtitution) appertains to any Man. Now this Habitude, or Title of Property, takes its Riſe from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what founded in the perſon, to whom ſuch Right is owing or accrews; whether it be by ſome Quality, or Action, or even any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as underſtood in the largeſt Senſe. For the Man, who falls into Poverty, but yet is Honeſt, has a ſort of Right or Title to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Alms: and he, who has gotten any thing by Lawful Induſtry, has Right to keep it; and the ſame, if it come to him by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. BUT altho all Right is founded in, and ariſeth from things themſelves (as they are the Object or Subject matter of perſonal Right) yet is not ſuch Right always clear or intelligible, without reference to ſome <hi>Law,</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:100094:67"/> which muſt explain it. So <hi>Andronicus Rhodius,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> in his Commentary upon <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſays,—<hi>In thoſe things the Right is placed, in which the Law is alſo placed: For Law and Judgment is that which ſeparates and diſcriminates Right from Wrong, and Juſt from Unjuſt.</hi> However, as all Law is not of one and the ſame Nature, ſo neither all Right: For there is <hi>Right Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> and <hi>Right Legal;</hi> and there is alſo <hi>Law Natural,</hi> and <hi>Law Poſitive.</hi> The firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth thoſe Sanctions, which are <hi>immovable</hi> and <hi>perinanent;</hi> as from the latter come ſuch as are <hi>temporary</hi> or <hi>mutable.</hi> Theſe laſt do not obtain in every place; ſince they were made and fitted to thoſe places only that ſtood in need of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. As to this <hi>Law of Nature, Cicero</hi> does in very apt, tho lofty, Terms, ſet it off in his Firſt Book <hi>de L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or any City or Society of Men were in being.</hi> But afterwards when he preſcribes, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever partakes of Divine Nature (as he plainly owns our Souls to do) ſhould be governed and directed by the Nature of God, by his Reaſon, Mind, Power, and Influence; in this he diſcovers, and reveals unto us, the Fountain and Original from whence proceeds the beſt and the moſt perfect Law of all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For what</hi> (ſays he) <hi>either among Men below, or in Heaven above, or in Earth, can be diviner
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100094:68"/> than Reaſon? This is the Faculty, which, being matur'd and come to its Perfection, is by a more exalted Name call'd</hi> true Sapience. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſince nothing is preferable to this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is conſpicuous in man, as well as is God; we may conclude, it was Reaſon that made the firſt Bond of Society between God and Man. And this Bond being a Law, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. § 9.</note> we may preſume that Men are conſociated to the Gods by Law.</hi> By which he plainly intimates, that this ſupreme Law, which was equally referable to Gods and Men, was <hi>Right Reaſon:</hi> and from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates a ſimilitude of Man with God.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. AGAIN in his ſecond Book, where he deſcribes this <hi>natural Law,</hi>

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4. § 3.</note> he calls it, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which reſulteth from the nature of things; and which did not (as he ſays) then begin to be a Law, when firſt it was written, but whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> it firſt had being; and that ſuch Being it had from Eternity in the Divine Will. So that Law, which is eminent and truly ſuch, fit to command, and fit to reſtrain, is the <hi>Right Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf. <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The truth is, all Men do agree, that the ſupreme Law is <hi>Right Reaſon:</hi> and this Reaſon, being alſo a Divine Thing, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immutable, always conſtant and like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf. But as it is placed in ſo mutable a Subject, as is human Nature, we ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times how this Reaſon is not ſo much altered, as even deſtroy'd and extinguiſh'd: But in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100094:68"/> God, and among the number of Bleſſed Spirits (which are, by <hi>Antoninus,</hi> called immortal Gods) the ſame Reaſon flouriſhes everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This ſeems alſo to be the very mind of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> that beſt Interpreter of <hi>Ariſtotle. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10</note> For altho</hi> (ſays he) <hi>among Men all Laws were mutable; yet 'tis of neceſſity, that with the Gods they ſhould be immutable, and that Right ſhould therefore be ſome natural Thing. Nay even among Men who are of ſound mind, and under any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, there is that immutable Law which is called Natural. For it does not much import, that Men of depraved minds do not comprehend what is juſt: ſince Honey is ſtill ſweet, tho to the ſick, who have loſt their reliſh, it may appear otherwiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is therefore a Law, which is eternal and immutable, and in ſome ſort common both to God and Men; namely <hi>Right Reaſon:</hi> which altho it enters not into the minds of Men wholly vitiated and profligate, yet ſtill is preſent, <note place="margin">

                  <p n="7">VII. Now 'tis from this immutable and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Law, that all other Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are drawn; even thoſe which are term'd mutable, and which would have no validity in them, unleſs by virtue of that high and eternal Law. And of this kind, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith in Contracts is a principal part. So <hi>Virgil,</hi>

                  <p>Wherefore, inaſmuch as every man is bound to ſtand to his Promiſe or Compact; he is tied to thoſe Ordinances, which are not ſuch by Nature, but by Law.

                  <head>CHAP. V. Of Piety.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. JUSTICE comprehends the two parts of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Probity.</hi> For Piety it ſelf is a ſort of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> by which we render to God the thing which is God's; that is to ſay, the thing which of Right appertaineth to him. And this Right of God's is very commonly term'd <hi>Worſhip:</hi> Which principally conſiſts in this, that we preſs vehemently to know him truly, as the infallible Means to love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him entirely. For as we are ſprung from him, and wholly depend upon his Will, ſo ought we to conſecrate all the Faculties of Soul and Body to his good Pleaſure, and to have our affiance in his Providence. And as to his holy Commands, whether thoſe that are writ in Books, or inſcribed inwardly in our Hearts; we muſt ſo fervently hearken and adhere thereto, as rather to bear all Infamy, Poverty, Oppreſſion, and even Death it ſelf, than quit our Integrity, or violate a good Conſcience. Theſe are God's Rights; and he that dares to derogate from them, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe them, does as much as in him lies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud and injure God himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. 'TIS very obvious, that in theſe ſorts of things, the true Worſhip of God does conſiſt,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100094:70"/> ſeeing all Men do by <hi>Worſhip,</hi> underſtand the Honor which is paid to God. Now 'tis plain, that thoſe, of all others, do pay moſt Hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to God, who (knowing the excellency of the Divine Nature, and alſo what Affinity the Mind of Man holds therewith) do moſt ardently contend to have that part of the Soul, which is ſo ally'd, preſerve its ſimilitude to the great Original; and do renounce all things, even life it ſelf, rather than to damnifie that holy Reſemblance.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. THERE can be no proof ſo convincing as this, of the Love, Honor, and Eſteem we pay to God. For while we reverence that poor Extract we bear of him; to the degree of ſpurning, not only the Pleaſures of Life, but even Life it ſelf, in compariſon of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, which in true Virtue and Right Reaſon can only be found: We do therein openly avow, that as God is infinitely more excellent than his poor Image; ſo is he by infinite Degrees both honor'd and valu'd by us above our ſelves. And to do otherwiſe, or to be negligent and languiſhing in his holy Worſhip, were either to be ignorant of a God, or elſe not to know that Reverence, which the Divine Nature both deſerves and demands from us.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. NOW that Virtue is a thing Divine, and God's true Image, is therein manifeſt, that 'tis defin'd to be not what is moſt grateful to the Animal Life, but that which is abſolutely and ſimply the beſt. It was in this high ſenſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100094:70"/> the ancient Philoſophers underſtood it: where <hi>Plato</hi> (teaching that Miſeries would then have an end, when we fled from this mortal ſtate unto the Gods) he ſays,—<hi>That ſuch Flight was our Tranſlation into the ſimilitude of God, and that ſuch ſimilitude (ſo far as it was poſſible) did conſiſt in our being holy, juſt, and prudent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. HE adds in another place, that the Divine Nature was the Law and Boundary to all temperate Men <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and to the prudent, God is the Law; but to the unadviſed, there was no Law, but their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</hi> And again he adds,—<hi>That God was the true Meaſure of all things, and not Man a Meaſure to himſelf.</hi> And again,—<hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was wiſe and honeſt was God's Friend, as being like unto him.</hi> By all which <hi>Plato</hi> incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, how divine a thing Virtue was, and how much ally'd, and reſembling unto God himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. HENCE it is that <hi>Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Tuſculan Queſtions,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tuſculan: Quaeſt.</hi> 6. <hi>l.</hi> 5.</note> has ſuch magnificent Words touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing human Souls;—<hi>As if,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the mind of man were but extracted from the mind divine; and to be compar'd with no other but God himſelf, if it were not arrogance ſo to ſpeak.</hi> And then explaining, in his firſt Book <hi>de Legibus,</hi> that ſaying from the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle of <hi>Noſce te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum,;</hi> he adds, <note place="margin">De Legib.</note>—<hi>That whoever knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, muſt preſently feel within him ſomething which is divine; That he muſt conclude the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding given him, ought to be but as ſome
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100094:71"/> Image dedicated to God; and that he ſtands bound both to ſay and act ſuch things as an worthy of ſo Heavenly a Gift.</hi>

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 12. § 19.</note> Conſonant hereto are the frequent Sayings of <hi>Marcus Antoninus,—.That we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> confeſs we have ſomewhat within us more extel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and divine than what ſubmits to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolment of our Paſſions, or than can be agitated by them as it were a mere Puppet.</hi> He adds a little after,—<hi>That every Man's Mind is a God, and had its Original from him.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> And again,—<hi>Why ſeek we farther than the immediate buſineſs of a Creature intellectual? One that loves Society, and partakes in thoſe Laws which are common to God?</hi> It were endleſs to name all he ſays: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 22.</note> yet, where he teaches in brief what it was to be converſant with the Gods, he ſays thus, <hi>That every Man lives with the Gods, who does what is dictated by that God, which</hi> Jupiter <hi>has given him for his Captain and Director.</hi> Meaning hereby, <hi>That every Man's own Reaſon, and his Intellect, was that Director or inferior God.</hi> Nay, ſo ally'd he thinks the Soul unto God, as to call it a diſmembred <hi>Parcel</hi> of him: altho herein he ſpoke but little as a Philoſopher.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. SINCE therefore there is ſo much of Divinity interwoven in a virtuous Mind; 'tis plain, that if we cultivate Virtue, as it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, and as 'tis his moſt viſible Image, we manifeſtly worſhip the great God himſelf. And whereas other Rituals have been ſubject to Mutation, and ſhall not be laſting; this one Right of Adoration,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100094:71"/> which is God's Right, muſt be immutable and everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Sum of all natural <hi>Religion</hi> ſeems to conſiſt in that Precept of <hi>Antoninus, To remember God, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. § 7.</note> and to know that he abhors all Hypocriſie, and will not be ſerv'd but with what is rational and like to himſelf.</hi> Or, as he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſpeaks, <hi>That a Man ſhould not rejoice, or acquieſce in any thing, but in paſſing from one good action to another; ſuch as had reference to God's Glory, and to the publick Good.</hi> For God's moſt <hi>immovable</hi> and <hi>immutable Right</hi> is this, that we love him for his wonderful Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then imitate him as much as we can.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. THIS however is not ſaid to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of other Rights; which have either been reveal'd by holy Oracles, or injoin'd by the Decree of the ſupreme Magiſtrate. For there may be various Ceremonies, and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Divine Worſhip, which, in Virtue of a Law, may be eſtabliſh'd as of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, and ſuch as may not be violated, till by Legal Authority they are revok'd. But ſtill theſe muſt have no Repugnancy in them, either to the Oracles of God, or to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Laws of Virtue.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Now from all that has been ſaid, 'tis eaſie to comprehend what <hi>Piety</hi> is; For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Definition, <hi>Holineſs is a part of Juſtice;</hi> and ſo <hi>Andronicus Rhodius</hi> (almoſt to the ſame ſenſe) defines it to be, <hi>A Science that makes us faithful and obedient unto the Laws Divine.</hi> Whence 'tis manifeſt what Impiety
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100094:72"/> muſt be: and how fitly it may be divided into theſe ſeveral kinds, namely, <hi>Superſtition, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and <hi>Rituality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Now <hi>Superſtition</hi> is a ſort or mode of Impiety, in faſtening upon God (by way of Worſhip) thoſe things which are contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious to him: which is plainly to be injurious to the Deity. Wherefore, <hi>Superſtition is that Impiety, by which a man conſiders God to be ſo light, or ſo paſſionate, as with trivial things ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be appeas'd, or elſe mov'd to wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> alſo is that Impiety, by which a Man does with Impudence and Imprudence violate all Divine Rights, whether temporary, or immutable. And this Diſeaſe does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ripen into downright <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> than which no ſtate of the Soul can be more ſad and deplorable.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. ENTHUSIASM is that Impiety, by which a Man does boldly violate, and kick under foot, all external Rights; while yet he drives on, with Heat and Ardor of Mind, to ſome internal and ſpiritual Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Rituality</hi> is that Impiety, by which a Man, while he is obſerving thoſe exterior Rights of God, and adheres with a ſort of Conſcience to things ceremonial; does in the mean time freeze, as to any ſpiritual Feeling, or internal Worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. THESE in a manner are thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in Religion, which are moſt obvious: but if others increaſe the number, I ſhall not gainſay it. I confeſs it was our intention to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100094:72"/> treat rather of the Virtues than of the Vices: But, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>However the Demonſtration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Virtue of Piety is particularly explain'd in <hi>Noema</hi> the thirteenth, ſixteenth, and twenty firſt: As alſo in the fifth, eighth, tenth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as to the Being of a God, and that our Souls are immortal; we have ſufficiently prov'd theſe in our Writings <hi>againſt Atheiſm, and of the Souls immortality:</hi> unto which we therefore refer.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of Probity: Or of Juſtice, properly ſo called.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. THE other part of <hi>Juſtice</hi> is <hi>Probity,</hi> by which we give to every Man what is his own. And this may be divided into three parts, <hi>Political, Oeconomical,</hi> and <hi>Moral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt contains the Offices of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate towards the People, and of the People to the Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond refers to the Duties of a Father towards Children, Wife, and Family; and of each of theſe towards their Maſter, Father, and Husband.</p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:100094:73"/>
                  <p>The third refers to the Duties of private Men, or at leaſt of equals, each to other. Of all which to ſpeak in particular would be too tedious.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. BUT this in ſhort may be ſaid, that 'tis not the part of a Magiſtrate to act againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or to be ſwayed by his own paſſion, but in all things to adhere to what is preſcribed by Law and by Right Reaſon. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls the Magiſtrate, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ethic. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. l.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The very Soul and Spirit of the Law;</hi> ſo <hi>Tully</hi> on the other hand holds, <hi>That a Magiſtrate ſhould not only be directed, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, lib.</hi> 3.</note> but even animated by the Laws. This</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is the Power and Duty of a Magiſtrate who preſides, that he direct things profitable and juſt, and ſuch as hold conformity with the Laws. For as the Magiſtrate is above the People, ſo are the Laws above the Magiſtrate.</hi> Now the Peoples Duty is, to obey the Magiſtrate, to contribute chearfully and liberally to the publick Charge; not to contend about things indifferent, ſuch as have by Cuſtom paſs'd into Right, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Peace, Society and good Order.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. THE Father of a Family ſhould be careful, to look about; to provide all things neceſſary; to treat with Gentleneſs his Wife, Children, and Servants: Above all, to avoid either giving pernicious example, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in others, but rather early to ſuppreſs, or expel it from the Houſe. On the other hand, 'tis the Duty of each of theſe reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to give the other all fit Obſervance; and, tho he ſhould at times be out of humor, or a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100094:73"/> little in the wrong, yet were it not wiſe or proper haſtily to contend or diſpute with him. For as <hi>Pittacus</hi> adviſed, <hi>'Tis not ſeemly to be wrangling with your Parents, altho what you ſpeak be the right.</hi> And indeed this Rule may well take place in reſpect of Magiſtrates, and even all that are ſuperior to us, either in Age or in Relation: And, even to our Uncles in particular, whom the Ancients called Parents.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. LASTLY, the Duty of private Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Equals, and indeed towards all, is, ever to be aiding either in Help or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, when it is in our power to do it. Much more are we tied to obſerve all our Compacts and Promiſes; but never to ſeek our own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by another Man's Hurt.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. NOW as to that celebrated Diviſion of Juſtice into <hi>Diſtributive</hi> and <hi>Corrective,</hi> it has chiefly reference to the Politicks. And in that Diviſion it is where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion takes place, namely, that <hi>Juſtice</hi> was a ſort of <hi>Equality.</hi> But the <hi>Equality</hi> whereto Juſtice inclines, and which it ſeems to affect, is of that ſort which ſhews it ſelf in the ways of <hi>Proportion.</hi> For Proportion is a <hi>Rationum Aequalitas,</hi> which <hi>Ratio</hi> (in the Language of Geometry) is that Relative Correſpondence which one Quantity or Number has to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or by which it appears, how often one Quantity or Number does comprehend, or is comprehended in another.</p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:100094:74"/>
                  <p n="6">VI. BUT as to Proportion or Analogy, this is either <hi>Geometrical</hi> or <hi>Arithmetical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Geometrical Proportion</hi> is when four Magnitudes, or four Numbers are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, namely, 2, 6; 4, 12; or 6, 2; 12, 4; As that the third (namely 12) in this latter Example, doth as often contain the Fourth (which is 4,) as the firſt (namely 6) does contain the ſecond (which is 2;) And that the third in the firſt Example (namely 4) is as often contain'd in the fourth (which is 12) as is the firſt (namely 2) in the ſecond (which is 6.)</p>
                  <p>This is the Proportion that refers to <hi>Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Juſtice.</hi> For as one perſon is to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuppoſe <hi>Ajax</hi> to <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſo alſo, in judicial Determinations, ought there to be had a due conſideration of Honor to Honor. This is that which is call'd the Equality of <hi>Proportion.</hi> For if the Merits of ſeveral Men ſhall happen to have the ſame Circumſtances and Reaſons of Equality; 'tis fit that not only in <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but even in <hi>Magnitude,</hi> their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhould be alſo equal.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. As for <hi>Arithmetical Proportion</hi> 'tis when four Numbers, or Magnitudes, are ſo compar'd, as in 5, 7: 9, 11. That the ſame Exceſs or Defect attends the two firſt each to other, as is in one of the latter to the other.

                  <p>But here we muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, that it ſeems hard to find in the Meaſures of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective Juſtice</hi> any ſufficient or competent Image of ſuch <hi>Arithmetical Proportion</hi> as in this Diſtinction of the ſaid four Terms is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. For whatever <hi>Andronicus</hi> thought to the contrary, 'tis plain, that the Exceſſes and Defects which ariſe from the Terms before enumerated, are not equal. 'Tis true, that two and two, as to the <hi>Ratio</hi> are equal. But to take two from ſeven, and but two from eleven, is as to <hi>Proportion</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal.

But when afterwards the offended Party takes on him the Name of Plaintiff, and the offending Party that of Defendant; here two other new Terms are ſtarted up, and then it follows, after Sentence given by the Judge; that the Exceſs or Difference, which before appear'd between him that did the wrong, and him that bore it, is quite inverted. For what the Doer or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant injuriouſly took, is now by Sentence commanded back; and by how much he firſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100094:75"/> overcame the Sufferer or Plaintiff by what he took away; by ſo much is he now pulled back; and damnified by what he is forced to refund. And this is true <hi>Arithmetical Proportion.</hi>

But he that is curious after ſuch Nicetias as theſe, may, if he think fit, conſult that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who dwells (as we conceive) too long on this Piece of Subtilty.

                  <p n="7">VII. LASTLY, When his Followers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Virtue to be this <hi>Medium,</hi> they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it in reſpect of two Things, which are <hi>Homogeneous</hi> or conſonant to ſuch <hi>Medium.</hi> For ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> does illuſtrate it by Examples of <hi>Arithmetical Proportion,</hi> as well in Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as Numbers: Altho after all, he ſeems herein rather to have found the <hi>Medium Rei,</hi> than the <hi>Medium quoad Nos;</hi> I mean that which is rather true in Speculation than in Practice. But his Affecting to make it <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous,</hi> is hereby manifeſt, That, while he calls Virtue a certain <hi>Medium,</hi> he makes it to partake of either Extreme. Thus <hi>Andronicus</hi> (his Paraphraſt) calls Virtue, <hi>The Middle of the Two Extremes falling ſhort on the one ſide and exceeding on the other:</hi> Even as it appears in <hi>Fortitude,</hi> which to a certain Degree may be term'd <hi>Confidence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT this can never hold: For while he this turns Confidence into Virtue (which ſtill is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to be a Thing abſolutely good) if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſuch his Confidence were a Virtue to the Degree of three, it would follow, That ſuch Confidence would doubly excel, if rais'd

                     </gap> would become better than Virtue; which muſt never be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we ſuppoſe, that Virtue is not the <hi>Medium</hi> it ſelf, but rather the Finder and the Chuſer of ſuch <hi>Medium.</hi> Nay, we affirm, that ſuch <hi>Medium</hi> is not ſingly diſcovered by the degrees of more or leſs, or of Exceſs or of Defect; but is alſo determin'd by other pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Circumſtances, even as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares: namely, <hi>That the true Medium in Virtue, <note place="margin">

                  <p n="11">XI. HOWEVER, if there be but Recourſe had to that Definition of <hi>Prudence,</hi> which we before have delivered, the point will be fully reſolv'd: For it will from thence appear that whoever is <hi>prudent</hi> is alſo of a Mind ſo cleans'd and defecated, that the Light of Truth is not eclipſed in him, either by Paſſions, or any corporeal Impediments. And, for this Cauſe, let no Man wonder, if <hi>Right Reaſon</hi> be ſtyl'd, <hi>That which is according to Prudence:</hi> For if the prudent Man, as to Life and good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, have it not, it can no where be found. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> to <hi>Nicomachus</hi>) is of the ſame mind. <hi>For the good Man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>judges all things aright; and Truth is viſible unto him, where-ever it be; and good things appear both proper and pleaſant in every ſhape. And 'tis very poſſible that a good Man grows more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, if, while he finds Truth in others, he has cauſe to think that he himſelf was the Rule and Meaſure thereof. But as to Plebeians, they tumble into Error for Pleaſure-ſake, as counting that real Good, which is really otherwiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Author has other Paſſages to the like intent: For he makes <hi>Temperance, the only true Guardian and Conſervator of Prudence:</hi> And that the ſober Man is only wiſe, in all that

                  <p n="12">XII. LET us therefore here applaud this wiſe Philoſopher, for that Variety of Truth and of Utility, which redounds from this Advice. For 'tis plain from hence, that our Minds, being thus purg'd from Vanities and Paſſions, can, as in an inſtant, diſcern not only all that is worthy and valuable in human Affairs, but what is noxious or of no account. Next, we may gather from it that ſome things are valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and worthy, even in their own Nature: ſince if they were not at all, <note place="margin">

                  <p>Laſtly, to waſte time in diſputing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing be (in its own Nature) laudable, before we take pains to reform our Minds in the way preſcrib'd, is not only Labor loſt, but a ſort of Frenzy. And if we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that nothing is of its own nature honeſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100094:88"/> and laudable, when at the ſame time we live in Vice and Wickedneſs, this is to be down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right impudent; for we ought firſt to try, and then to give our Opinion. We have touch'd this point before, and therefore we need not dwell upon it any longer here.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. THERE is now but one thing more, to clear before us all the Difficulty that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. For whereas it may ſound as if we give up our prudent Man to Inſpirations and to Enthuſiaſm; while we contend he cannot in any other reſpect be wiſe, than as his Mind is reform'd and purg'd: and that it muſt alſo needs hence enſue, that whatſoever a Man ſo purg'd, ſhall afterwards imagine, muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be according to Right Reaſon, or Right Reaſon it ſelf, merely becauſe he thinks ſo: And that, in ſhort, there muſt be no other Meaſure, or Principle; but that his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be as the Standard of Congruity and of Right.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is neceſſary (as <hi>Andronicus Rhodius</hi> ſpeaks) firſt to inquire and find out, <hi>What is the Mode and Standard of this Right Reaſon? And what that Principle in human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs that is juſt and congruous?</hi> For ſurely that alone is Right Reaſon, which to ſuch Standard, Mode, and Principle, can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd; and this muſt be ſome Primitive Good, which is not only moſt ſimple, but moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and a true <hi>Baſis, Norma</hi> and <hi>Standard,</hi> for all the reſt.</p>

Now, in the laſt place, if any ſhall object that we have done amiſs; and that all this ſplendid Fabrick of the Virtues is by us laid on a weak and tottering Foundation: As namely in Paſſion, ſuch as they may ſuppoſe this our <hi>Love</hi> to be. Let them for their better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, know, that this Love is not more a Paſſion than is Intellection it ſelf, which ſurely they cannot but believe to be very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and very Divine. 'Tis very true we may as to this point (with <hi>Des Cartes</hi>) allow, that all Intellection has ſo much of Paſſion, as it is the Perception of ſomething imprinted from without. However, as this Perception, which is made by Intellection, is not from the Body, but rather from the Soul, exerting and exciting her ſelf into ſuch Action: So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this Love from the Body; but either from the Soul it ſelf, or elſe from God above, who calls and quickens the Soul to ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Effort.</hi> And tho this Perception may, if they pleaſe, be termed a ſort of Paſſion, yet 'twill derogate no more from the Dignity and Excellency of it, than from Intellection it ſelf: Which, becauſe 'tis an Act of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, may on that account be alſo termed a Paſſion.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:100094:90"/>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. YET when all is ſaid, perhaps this Love, which we inſiſt upon, may not ſo truly be termed a Paſſion, as acknowledg'd to be the Peace and Tranquillity of the Mind: nay a ſtate of ſuch Serenity, as hath no other Motions than thoſe of Benignity and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. So that this Love may rather be thought a firm and unſhaken Benignity, or Bounty of the Soul; ſuch as has nothing more perfect, or more approaching to the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods. I mean hereby that State of the Bleſſed Spirits, unto which we ought all to aſpire: and ſurely without this Love, thoſe very Spirits would not be as Gods, but as a Race of Devils. And therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Love, to be the moſt perfect, and the moſt Angelick Thing of all others; far excelling even Intellection it ſelf. And, in truth, more aptly deſerving thoſe lofty Words, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beſtows upon the Speculative Intellect; where he ſays, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>That according to ſome Doctors we are not to converſe with human things, altho we are Men, nor with things tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory, altho we are mere Mortals; but, as much as is poſſible, we ſhould affect to live as do the immortal Gods: And this, by performing every thing in ſuch ſort, as conforms to that Principle, which is the moſt excellent thing within us.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. X. Of Good Things, which are External.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. 'TIS not only ſuch Things as are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without a Man, that we call <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Goods;</hi> but whatever is placed without in reſpect to Virtue: I mean without which Virtue may conſiſt in its Perfection, altho ſuch things may indeed paſs as Ornaments to her, and as neceſſary Complements unto Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And theſe are threefold; either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Soul,</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> or of <hi>both.</hi> We will touch upon ſome particulars herein; and ſee how far they help, or how ſhort they fall, as to the compleating of Happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. THINGS which relate to the <hi>Soul,</hi> are the <hi>Dexterity</hi> or <hi>Subtilty of the Wit, a vaſt and faithful Memory:</hi> Alſo <hi>Science, Art,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:100094:91"/>
                  <p>To the <hi>Body, Strength, Agility, Comlineſs,</hi> and <hi>Health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>both</hi> theſe, as they conſtitute Man, <hi>Wealth, Liberty, Nobility, Authority:</hi> And laſtly the <hi>Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>Favor</hi> of <hi>many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of all theſe we may ſay in ſhort, that they are Good, and more to be deſired than the things that are contrary to them: And yet that ſeveral of them are of ſuch ſlender Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that their Abſence does no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Perfection and Integrity of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than Mountains and Valleys do ſpoil the Roundneſs of the Earth, whoſe Magnitude makes thoſe ſmall Inequalities of no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Scarce do thoſe things add unto Happineſs while preſent, or retrench from it when abſent; inaſmuch as they hold no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with complete and perfect Virtue.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I would fain know what great matter is gotten by <hi>Subtilty of Wit;</hi> if a Man be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prudent, if his Mind be firm and unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if he have Love towards his Neighbor, and Good Will for Mankind?</p>
                  <p>I find <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperor, when he blamed his Parts for want of ſufficient Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, could yet conſole himſelf with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 7. § 67.</note> 
                     <hi>That a happy Life was made up of very few things; and that, altho a Man were neither Logician nor Philoſopher, he might yet be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, modeſt, a Lover of his Country, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to God.</hi> On the other hand, to hear one lament his Unhappineſs, for want of ſuch <hi>high Subtilty,</hi> or <hi>Dexterity of Wit;</hi> is little other,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100094:92"/> than if a Man ſhou'd complain he was not able to walk, becauſe not able, as ſome Juglers to dance upon a Rope.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. As to a ſtrong and retentive <hi>Memory,</hi> which holds all faſt, how many an honeſt Man is there that has it not? For, as <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> ſaid before, ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo ſays, <hi>That thoſe Noble and Divine Things, wherein Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did conſiſt, were very few.</hi> Nay rather that it was but one certain thing, by which the Diſcrimination was made of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt or vile, even as all Variety of Colors are judg'd of by the Eye. And hereto may refer that of <hi>Plato, That Truth was contain'd in a very narrow ſpace.</hi> For the good and perfect Man is not ſo much actuated by a Liſt of Precepts gotten without Book, as by living inwardly, and printing in his Mind a ſingle and ſincere Senſe of Things. From this alone, he will be able to know whatever Duty lies incumbent on him; juſt as, by one Candle, a Man may ſee all the variety of Objects before him: And as all Colors of the Rainbow do ariſe from the Sun, ſo indeed the Diſtinction of all Duties have but the ſame ſingle Source.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>exterior</hi> things, and ſuch as are not reducible into this Diviner Senſe: Let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, if your Memory be as that of an old Man, who (as they ſay) does not eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get whatever he takes to heart, and lets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing go that may much afflict him if it be loſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. As to <hi>Science, Art,</hi> and <hi>Sapience;</hi> we do not conceive they are ſo very eſſential un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100094:92"/> Happineſs. For tho <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> 
                     <hi>That Science is about neceſſary Matters, and ſuch as are not ſubject to Alteration;</hi> Yet this our Happineſs does not conſiſt in thoſe immutable Things, but in the ſingle Conſtancy of Mind, and in a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Reſolution to proſecute, in all our Actions, that which is ſimply and abſolutely the beſt. And therefore, in that admirable Table of <hi>Cebes,</hi> they who thus purſue Virtue, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted within the ſecond Pale; while others have no admiſſion at all into the <hi>Palace of Safety,</hi> neither the Men of Logick, nor of Figures, nor of Geometry, nor Aſtrologers, Poets, Orators, or Muſicians: But all alike, even as infamous or uſeleſs Fidlers, are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſhut without.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. THAT Happineſs, which is due to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, is a plainer Thing, and a more common Good, than to be calculated only for Philoſophers and Artiſts. Wherefore as <hi>Science</hi> is not to be counted a part of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo neither is that <hi>Art,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p n="7">VII. MUCH leſs ought <hi>Sapience</hi> to paſs for ſuch an Eſſential; ſeeing <hi>Her Objects are Things ſingular, ſtupendous, difficult, and even Magical:</hi> Such as <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Thales</hi> of old are ſaid to have ſtudied, and which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> upbraids a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> unprofitable, and little availing to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of human Life. But as to <hi>Magical Things</hi> here ſpoken of, his Meaning appears
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100094:93"/> by his defining in that place, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ethic. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Sapience to be the Skill and Underſtanding of thoſe Things which in Nature have the chiefeſt Excellence.</hi> And a while after, <hi>That there were other things, which by Nature were far Diviner than Men; as thoſe illuſtrious and conſpicuous Objects, whereof the World was fram'd.</hi> 'Tis theſe therefore are thoſe <hi>Magical Matters,</hi> that are called Objects of <hi>Sapience,</hi> and which are reputed more <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Excellent than Man.</hi> But yet for any Science herein, 'tis ſo far from being neceſſary to Happineſs, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> will ſcarce allow it to be uſeful.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. NOW altho perfect Happineſs, which is that Pleaſure that ariſeth from a Senſe of Virtue, and a Conſcience of <hi>Well-doing,</hi> may want <hi>Science, Art,</hi> and <hi>Sapience;</hi> yet we muſt alſo affirm, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> that ſuch <hi>Intelligence</hi> as, by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus,</hi> is defin'd, <hi>To be the Knowledge of Principles,</hi> can by no means be ſeparate from Happineſs. For 'tis in truth impoſſible that a Mind, which is purified and influenced by true Prudence, can be ſo blunt or ſtupify'd, as to admit any Doubt concerning the Principles of Science.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. FOR what concerns <hi>Bodily Endowments,</hi> we may venture to ſay that <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility,</hi> are more the Happineſs of the Bull, and of the Squirrel, than of a Man. Nay a brawny and robuſt Habit is ſo far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapting Men to Virtue, that the Senſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Things is often dull'd and ſuffocated thereby. And it would be as unreaſonable to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100094:93"/> expect that all good Men ſhould be Robuſt and Agil, as to compel them all to be Racers, or good at Fiſty-Cuffs.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. As to <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>Comlineſs,</hi> the plain Truth is, it has a Charm; for it draws Favor, and ſtrangely turns the Minds of the Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and even Virtue it ſelf is indebted to the Ornaments it beſtows,
<q>
                        <l>Gratior eſt pulchro veniens de corpore Virtus.</l>
                     </q>
                     <q>
                        <l>Beauty, when with Virtue joyn'd,</l>
                        <l>Gives a luſtre to the Mind.</l>
                     </q> Yet after all, 'tis but a poor Ingredient of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Happineſs. It ſeems rather to be anothers good than our own. If we had not a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs, we cou'd know nothing of it. Whereas internal Beauty needs no ſuch help, the Mind is ſatisfied of it ſelf, and 'tis a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaſt.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. HEALTH, I confeſs, is one of the chiefeſt Bleſſings, and 'tis certainly neceſſary to complete Happineſs; at leaſt ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion thereof, as may exempt the Body from Torture, and the Mind from Rage and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction. For whatſoever ſhall either extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Operations of the Mind, or compel them to Evil, and there detain them, muſt either deſtroy Happineſs, or make it very imperfect.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. AMONG the <hi>good Things of Fortune,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Wealth</hi> be beſt, has been a Doubt. I for my part have ſtill preferr'd the firſt; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince <hi>Wealth</hi> implies ſomewhat of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, with which a good Man may well
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100094:94"/> diſpenſe. Wherefore the Loſs of Wealth would in no degree afflict me like that of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſo as a Competency were but left for Life. And I ſhould think it more Gentle, as well as more Tolerable, to be depriv'd of thoſe things which are ſuperfluous to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than to be truſted with too much. For if the top of human Felicity conſiſts in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, 'tis much if it be not damnified by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations which Plenty draws us into.</p>
                  <p>In the Caſes even of <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Servitude,</hi> they ſeem nothing dreadful; if they are but ſo qualified, as not to hinder the Mind in the Exerciſe of Virtue, nor to extinguiſh the Senſe of that Pleaſure, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. § 19.</note> which a pious Soul takes in ſubmitting to God. For to him, who gives up his Will and Affections to a Conformity with the Divine Providence, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Raptures of Joy, which a Senſe of that Obedience, and that Reſignation affords him.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. As for <hi>Nobility,</hi> that this is not needful for Happineſs ſeems herein evident, that 'tis but a Shadow of Anceſtors Virtue, which is caſt upon Poſterity. And if this Shadow be any Thing; how great then is Virtue it ſelf, which can ſo gild, and for Ages to come ſo glorifie, a Race of Men by her mere Reflection? Surely where Virtue her ſelf is preſent (whoſe Rays could do ſo much) what Bleſſings will not this great Parent of ſolid happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow? He that has Virtue, will ſtand in want of Nobility no more, than does the Sun of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100094:94"/> that Light, which is borrow'd from him, I mean, the Light of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore bare <hi>Nobility</hi> makes but little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Happineſs: But if the Virtue alſo of Anceſtors ſhall deſcend upon their Poſterity, then indeed it has equal, if not a greater Force towards Human Felicity, than if Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were deſtitute of that Help.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. BUT if <hi>Nobility</hi> be not neceſſary to a happy Life, much leſs is <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> For no Man will hold, that Princes only and Magiſtrates are happy; ſince the Number of them is ſo few, in reſpect of other Mortals: ſince alſo they are vexed with Cares, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd about with Dangers.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. LASTLY, As to <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> it muſt be confeſs'd, that Favor, and the good Will of Men, adds a wonderful Complacency to Life, as well as Security. And indeed Virtue can hardly ſtand without it; eſpecially if ſuch <hi>Friendſhip</hi> be attended with perfect Sincerity, and with a certain ſweetneſs of Behaviour and Benignity of Mind. Beſides all Men of Probity are in a ſort confederated; and being by Virtue, as by a Mark of Diſtinction put conſtantly in mind of the Relation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity which ties them together, they look upon themſelves as obliged, to cheriſh and aſſiſt each other.</p>
                  <p>But if it be a Man's hard Hap, to live and converſe only among the wicked, we muſt then depend upon the Protection of the Laws. <hi>For,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rightly takes notice, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>the Rules
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100094:95"/> of Policy and the Doctrines of Morality, do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> aim at the ſame thing.</hi> And <hi>Andronicus</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly expounds it, ſaying, <hi>That the ſame Advantage is ſought for, as well from every ſingle Man, as from the City or Government.</hi> So that a good Man will want but little as to ſolid Felicity, if he may get what belongs to him even by Natural Right. Nor does that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Example of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias</hi> ſeem more to refer to <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> than it does to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and <hi>Equity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore Virtue, and eſpecially among good Men, or in a good Government, ſeems not to want, or ſtand in need of more Favor, than ſhe is able to prevail for, upon her own Account.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. HOWEVER, that I may diſguiſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is manifeſt, that Iniquity is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times interwoven in the very Texture of the Laws, and in thoſe more eſpecially that have regard unto Religion. And it often happens that for the Cauſe of Truth and Virtue, we fall into the Diſpleaſure and Hatred of Men: For vicious Minds can no better endure the Trials of Virtue and of Truth, than vitiated Eyes can endure the Sun. Of this poor <hi>Socrates</hi> found ſad effects; and ſo have innumerable others, as well <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as <hi>Jews.</hi> In this Caſe, 'tis certainly more adviſable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe but with a few, and thoſe of the moſt approved Integrity. But if there be no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Companions of this ſort, there is no other Remedy left, but to withdraw, and embrace
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100094:95"/> Solitude: <hi>Which however,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Politico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> (in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) <hi>no Man can be contented with, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he becomes a God or a Beaſt.</hi> Yet, in my Sentiment, a good Man, even in this State, ceaſes not to be joyful, and happy: for tho he be not a God, yet he bears about him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is Divine; And, while he can feel and contemplate the Joys thereof, he can want nothing that is eſſential to true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. BUT if it ſhall happen that Men will ſtill be malevolent, and by their ill Nature give Diſturbance even to this Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement: Here, I confeſs, there wants not only the Friendſhip of Equals, but rather Patronage from the powerful, which might avert this Malice, and retort the envenomed Darts. Yet if none of theſe may be had; let the good Man, fill'd with the Conſcience and Senſe of God, betake himſelf to the Armor of <hi>Patience, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Magnanimity.</hi> Let him revolve on that of <hi>Epictetus, <note place="margin">

However as he bears all with equal Temper, not ſtupify'd or inſenſible, but, with a magnanimous Soul; the very Splendor of Virtue ſhines out in the midſt of all his Suffering. For ſince Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has its being in the Operations of Virtue, and that ſuch Operations do govern the Life of him that is happy; 'tis impoſſible that any happy Man can be made miſerable, becauſe he will never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in what is odious and vile.</hi> He alſo adds, <hi>That the happy Man looks not that all things ſhould flow in according to his Wiſh, but he makes the beſt of his preſent Fortune. And hence it is that he can never be made miſerable, tho he fall into the greateſt Miſeries: For it can only be ſaid of him in reſpect of Fortune, he will not be baſely happy.</hi> But the Words of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf are a little more dejected, <note place="margin">

                  <p n="8">VIII. BUT to make the truth of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion more manifeſt; Let us take Notice what this <hi>Liberum Arbitrium</hi> or <hi>Free-Will</hi> is; and then Demonſtrate that there is really ſuch a Principle within us. Firſt, Liberty of the Will, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Autexouſion,</hi> ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to imply, The <hi>having a Power to Act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> not Act within our ſelves.</hi> Now in that <hi>Free-Will</hi> is a Principle of Acting within one's ſelf, it ſo far agrees with what the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſion,</hi> which is the ſame as <hi>Spontaneous:</hi> And which (as <hi>Andronicus</hi> defines it) is that, <hi>Whoſe Principle of Acting is wholly in the Age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</note> Yet what he ſtraight ſubjoins in the ſame Chapter, ſaying, <hi>That in what a Man Acts, as mov'd thereunto by himſelf, he is Lord and Maſter of Doing it, or letting it alone.</hi> This I think is not altogether ſo exact.</p>
                  <p>For a Man may Act out of his own mere Motion; that is to ſay, from ſuch inbred Principles of Virtue, and by ſo ſtrong and efficacious a ſenſe of Honeſty, as not to be able to act otherwiſe, or to draw his Will to any different Thing. For inſtance, an Honeſt Man has Power indeed, by his Wit and bodily Force, treacherouſly to deſtroy an Innocent Man, and even one that has well deſerved of him. But can that Honeſt Man
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100094:99"/> do this Thing? No, God forbid! He dare not let himſelf do it. For that vigorous and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ely ſenſe of what is Honeſt, and with which his Mind is tinctur'd and poſſeſs'd, can by no means permit him to execute ſo horrid a Villany. Now as ſuch a Perſon, tho never ſo much ſollicited by Promiſes and Rewards, ſtarts back, and (in the ſenſe of <hi>Antonine</hi>) ſtops all his Faculties of Motion, and does not reſign himſelf to ſo baſe a Fact; this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is entirely <hi>from himſelf,</hi> and none elſe is the Cauſe, why <hi>that</hi> Advantage is not taken. However, I ſay, he is not, in this Caſe, ſo much Maſter of his Forbearance, as that it is in his power not to forbear. I grant (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) that if he would, he were able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo wicked a Thing; but that he is able to Will it, or bring his Will unto it, is what I utterly deny.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. WE ſay therefore there is ſome Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between having <hi>Free-Will,</hi> and being a <hi>Voluntary</hi> or <hi>Spontaneous Agent.</hi> The former is more reſtrain'd and particular, and obtains in fewer Caſes; the latter is more large and general. When we ſay that a Man has <hi>liberum Arbitrium</hi> or <hi>Free-will,</hi> we add a particular Difference to the general Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Voluntarineſs,</hi> that is to ſay, We ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he is ſuch a voluntary Agent, as can Act and not Act as he pleaſes: Whereas to the being a voluntary Agent, ſimply or generally ſpeaking, there is no ſuch Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence required. It is ſufficient to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100094:100"/> any Agent to be ſuch, <note place="margin">Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> whoſe Principle of Action is in himſelf, and who underſtands and takes cognizance of his own Actions and the Circumſtances that relate to them: The, in the mean time, it may not be in his Power, every time he Acts, to Act otherwiſe than he does.</p>
                  <p>This now being the Notion of <hi>Spontaneous</hi> or <hi>Voluntary;</hi> we ſee plainly what is the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to it; namely, every thing that proceeds either from <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Outward Force.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Action is done from either of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, muſt needs be inſpontaneous and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary. For in the one Caſe (that of <hi>Force</hi>) the Agent does not act from his own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but is compelled from without: In the other Caſe (that of <hi>Ignorance</hi>) tho he act from his own Principle, yet he has no Notice of the Moral Circumſtances of the Action, which if he had known, he would not have done that Action.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. BUT now as to <hi>Liberum Arbitrium,</hi> or <hi>Freedom of the Will;</hi> what we call by that Name is only that ſort of Spontaneity or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarineſs in us; which is ſo free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd, that it is in our Power, to Will or Act this way or the other way, as we pleaſe. This (I ſay) is properly <hi>Free-Will;</hi> and it ſuppoſeth a free Election or Choice in our ſelves: And accordingly <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dronicus</hi> (from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) defines it to be, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>A deliberate Wiſss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Appetition of thoſe Things, which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Power.</hi> For thoſe things (ſays he)
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100094:100"/> are the ſubjects of Deliberation, whereof eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is Maſter to do them, or to leave them undone: And theſe are thoſe very Things, which he declares to be within our Power.</p>
                  <p>Now this Power of not Acting, when it regards thoſe things which are Baſe and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, is a great Perfection; But when it has reſpect to things that are Noble and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, 'tis a great Imperfection: For 'tis in the very next Degree to Acting diſhoneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be able to incline the Will towards an Action that is vile.</p>
                  <p>However, to know we are able, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with a Power to abſtain from a vile Thing (tho poſſibly we do not abſtain) this is a ſort of Perfective State, and of high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence for a Man to diſcover in himſelf whether he have it or no.</p>
                  <p>Now that ſuch a real Power is planted in Man, of being able to abſtain from doing ill, tho he fails at ſome times to exert that Power, is very plain from the Inſtances that follow.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. WE need not bring hereunto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Help, than what was noted before, in the Chapter about the Interpretation of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

                  <head>CHAP. II. Two Principal Objections againſt <hi>Free-Will</hi> are Propos'd and Anſwer'd.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. THE firſt Objection ariſeth from God's Fore-knowledg; which (they ſay) muſt take away all Contingency, and, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. §. 5.</note> in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the Liberty of Man's Will.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is taken from the Nature of Good, altho but Apparent: For as often or
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100094:102"/> as long as any thing ſeems Good or Excellent to any one in the Circumſtances he then is in, his Will is neceſſarily compell'd to embrace it, becauſe there is no Motive either to diver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him, or ſuſpend his Aſſent. For ſince the Will of Man is ſo fram'd, as to bend this Way or that, according to the Weight and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Object; it ſeems impoſſible it ſhould not bend, where moſt Reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, and when nothing is in the other Scale to counterpoiſe it: Nay, if ſomething ſhould be in the other Scale, yet ſtill that Good which is moſt Apparent will certainly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh. For there is no Reaſon to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, why a Man ſhould be prevail'd on by a leſſer Good, more than by no Good at all: Since if, in the Scale of Reaſon, that which is Leſs ſhould weigh down that which is Greater, then a Leſs than that, till it came to Nothing, would preponderate; and alſo our Reaſon and Election would thus be mov'd by Nothing: Both which are abſurd to Believe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Will evermore inclines to that Good which is moſt apparent; and upon that account 'tis neceſſarily determin'd to <hi>One Thing:</hi> Whence it comes to paſs, that we have no ſuch thing as <hi>Free-Will</hi> in us, and that we could never have acted otherwiſe than as we have already done.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. AS to the firſt of theſe Objections, the Anſwer is not hard. 'Tis true, we cannot otherwiſe think of God's Fore knowledg, but to be every way clear and perfect, and without
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100094:102"/> poſſibility of Error, as to thoſe Objects about which he judges or does pronounce. And firely he does always judg and determine of things according as they are; that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to ſay, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>contingent thing, that it is contingent; and of a neceſſary thing that it is neceſſary. Whence is comes to paſs, that thoſe things, which are comingent and proceed from a Free Principle of Acting, they are allow'd to be ſuch by God's Conſent. For we ought not to confine God's Omniſcience within narrower Bounds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n we do his Omnipotence, which all Men acknowledg to be able to do whatever does not imply a Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, to diſparch this Difficulty in afew words: We ſay that the Fore-knowledg of contingent Effects, which proceed from a free Principle of Acting, does either imply a Contradiction, or it does not. If it does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Contradiction, then ſuch Effects are not the Objects of God's Omniſcience, nor determin'd by it, or rightly ſuppos'd to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd at all. But if it do not imply a Contradiction, then we actually confeſs, that Divine Preſcience and Man's Free Will, are not inconſiſtent, but that both of them may ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly ſtand with each other. Therefore by neither way, can any ſound or convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be drawn from God's Fore-knowledg againſt the Liberty of Man's Will.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. AS to the other Difficulty, the whole Senſe thereof falls within this Proverbial Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Nemo eſt lubens Malus, aut Beatus invitas;</hi>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:100094:103"/> that is, <note place="margin">

Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> No Man is willingly Wicked, or Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py againſt his Will: Or elſe into that ſaying of <hi>Socrates, Omnis Improbus ignorat,</hi> That no Man was Wicked, but through Ignorance. Which ſounds as if the Will of Man wanted nothing, but the Knowledg of what was Good and Virtuous, to force him to imbrace it: Nay, that the Will was ſo fram'd, as not to be able to reſiſt that Good, which it did but once underſtand. Now if this were true, there would not need ſo much Exhortation to the love of Virtue, as to the Study of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Nor would the Liberty of Man's Will conſiſt ſo much in Pre-election, as in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Deliberations: and theſe to be ſtill ſo Govern'd, as that nothing ſhould prove re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to ſome Excellent End.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. WHEREFORE inaſmuch as we find that Idea of the chief End, which is termed <hi>Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> or <hi>Happineſs,</hi> to be but confuſedly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by us; 'tis every Man's Duty with principal Care to find out, in what this chief <hi>Happineſs</hi> doth conſiſt, and how we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: Yet whether all this be plac'd within every Man's Reach, is a very hard thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
                  <p>We ſee, the Bulk of Mankind are like thoſe; who, falling ſick of a Diſeaſe and not knowing how to cure themſelves, ought to be viſited by others that are in Health, and from them take Remedies and Advice. So the Generality, that ſee little of themſelves, while they are dazled by falſe Lights and the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100094:103"/> bare Apparitions of Good, can never diſcover, What is the Ultimate Good, and what the moſt Excellent Object of Human Life. <hi>For</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerv'd) <hi>all men ſeek after Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Good; <note place="margin">

                  <p n="5">V. 'TIS in the Third Book of his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> that the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> propoſes this Queſtion; and yet he does not otherwiſe clear it, than by granting, That it was ſome time or other in the Power of thoſe, who now are Blinded, to have beheld what was truly Good; and that Men are not leſs willingly Bad than Good: But this does not directly ſatisfie the Objection. Alſo he is pleas'd to expoſe it with more Words and Ornaments than is uſual with him, as in manner following, <hi>That no Man is to himſelf the Cauſe of doing Ill, but that ſuch Things are done by Ignorance of the End, and as Hoping he ſhall thereby attain what a Beſt for him. That the Deſire of the End falls not within our Choice: but that it imports every Man to be ſo born, as Naturally to See and Diſcern that what he chooſeth is truly Good: And he, who has this Felicity by Birth, is as it were Inſpir'd, and much oblig'd to Nature. For he ſhall poſſeſs that High and Excellent Good, which could never have been had either by Purchaſe, or by Inſtruction, had it not come by Birth-Right. And thus to be born, and under ſo benign a Planet, is the true Perfection of Ingenuity.</hi>

                  <p n="11">XI. THIS alſo is the Senſe of what we quoted before, out of <hi>Antonine:</hi> Namely, That we ſtood bound, not onely to conſpire with the very Air that ſurrounds us, but to concur with that Intellectual Power, which comprehends All. <note place="margin">

                     <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Power, was no leſs diſpers'd, and even extended to every Man, who was prepar'd to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe it, than was the open AIr to him, who had Lungs, and a Deſire to Breath it.</hi> 'Tis plain, we want nothing for attracting this Power unto us, but that Sincere Love, by which we are taught the true Reliſh of Virtuous Things. For 'tis thus alone we can grow upwards, and have Conjunction with God himſelf; Since Virtue, being the Divineſt of all Things, has moſt Power to aſſimilate us unto Him.

This is the onely Way to bring the Soul to thoſe Operations that are Pure, and to thoſe Pleaſures that are Divine;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100094:111"/> having no Reference or Dependence at all on Carnal Things. And this indeed was the Top of all <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philoſophy, which made him therefore ſtyle it, <hi>The Meditation of</hi> Death.</p>

                  <p n="14">XIV. IN the Second Place, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>How conſummate and even ineffable that Pleaſure is, that fills and poſſeſſes the Soul in Virtue.</hi> For ſeeing the Diſtemper and Lapſe of the Soul, is from a ſtate of Virtue into that of Vice; it cannot otherwiſe be, but that, when ſhe is call'd back to her Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Condition, there muſt be Raptures of Joy, at ſuch Reſtitution. For the Philoſophers make <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> in its very Definition to be, <hi>The Reſtitution to a Natural State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:100094:111"/>
                  <p>But ſurely, the moſt Natural State of that which partakes of Reaſon, muſt be Virtue: inaſmuch as Virtue is nothing elſe, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Aptitude and Propenſity to the Dictates of Right Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>To which we may add what is noted by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>

                  <p n="15">XV. IN the third Place, we may here ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradd, <hi>That this Life of Virtue, and this Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reſulting from it, is the moſt Divine of all other Things.</hi> For a Soul, that is got thus far, has nothing farther to wiſh, unleſs out of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to aim at ſomething which is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect than even the Deity it ſelf. But alas, that which is a Creature cannot be God: For all that he can have muſt be by Participation, and through the help of Virtue, which (as all confeſs) is a ſort of Divine Nature and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Life. For the Creature, as he is Animal, can onely follow what is grateful to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: 'Tis, as he is the Image of God, that he proſecutes that which is ſimply and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently the Beſt.</p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:100094:112"/>
                  <p>Wherefore as to this Point, <hi>Hierocles,</hi> while he owns both Life and Pleaſure ariſing from Virtue, to be perfectly Divine, does dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly play the Philoſopher in ſaying, <note place="margin">In Aurea Pytagorae Carmina.</note> 
                     <hi>Since therefore Life, which conforms to Virtue, and ſo carries a Divine Similitude, muſt needs be Divine; and that which abides in Vice, muſt needs be Brutiſh and Atheiſtical: 'Tis manifeſt, that the Pleaſures of a Good Man are Imitations of Divine Joy, becauſe his Mind is Aſſociating with God; Whereas that which is ſtyled the Pleaſure of a Wicked Wretch, is onely a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is altogether ſtupid and Brutal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereto alſo refers, what the ſame Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſpeaks of that <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is the Rule of Virtue, ſaying, <hi>That to obey Right Reaſon, and to Obey God, is the ſame Thing: For a Rational Being, that ſufficiently partakes of Natural Illumination, Wills and Covets the ſame Things, which the Divine Law ordains. And a Soul, that is fram'd according to God, falls into the ſame Determinations with God; and, by contemplating that Light and Majeſty which is Divine, does the ſame things, which God in like Circumſtances would do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. MANY things of the ſame Force, occur in ancient Writers, and more eſpecially in <hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Cicero;</hi> which from what has been cited will eaſily be believ'd. We ſhall therefore add, out of the firſt Book of <hi>Tully de Legibus,</hi> onely that ſhort ſaying, Namely, <hi>That Virtue was in Man the ſame as in God.</hi> But if the Caſe ſtand thus, What can be a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100094:112"/> more Natural, or binding Conjugation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, than this is? 'Tis alſo referable to the pleaſure of Virtue and of the Divine Life, what the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays elſewhere, in adviſing a Man to conſult his own <hi>Delphic</hi> Oracle, that is, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>The Knowledg of Himſelf and of his own Soul:</hi> For thus the Mind, being made ſenſible how exempt it was from Vice, and how conjoin'd to the Divine Nature; it might be filled with Joys that were unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. THE truth is, there was little need, thus to heap up, and with the Authority of the <hi>Ancients</hi> thus to adorn, what, as we have ſo often affirmed, was by the very Nature and Definition of Virtue ſo ſufficiently manifeſt. For to proſecute what is Simply the Beſt, and not what is moſt grateful to the <hi>Animal Nature,</hi> has ſtill been inculcated to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Divine, and manifeſtly elevated above the Animal State. Wherefore we muſt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arely confine our ſelves to the Beſt Principle we find about us, but muſt live up to that, which our Nature, at its full improvement, is moſt capable of; and that which is truly and really Divine. And this is what ought to be eſteem'd the Supreme Pleaſure, the Chief Good, and Ultimate End; In which our Soul, as in its higheſt Perfection and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, ought only to Acquieſce.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. SUCH Reflections as theſe, can ſcarce ever fail to inflame our Minds in the Study of Virtue. And there are yet ſome farther
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100094:113"/> things which may facilitate, and guide us in the ſame courſe. Among which the firſt Rule of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> is, <hi>That we never meddle with any thing raſhly, or without due Conful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">XX. ANOTHER is of <hi>Epictetus, Never to act any Thing againſt our own Conſcience;</hi> But that, as well in Small Matters as in Great, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it ſound and unſhaken. And to this End let another Precept of the ſame Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher be ſtill before us, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Enchiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion, c.</hi> 75.</note> 
                     <hi>Quicquid videtur Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum, id Lex eſto tibi inviolabilis.</hi> Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appears unto you to be Beſt, let it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as an Inviolable Law; For he that once learns (tho even with the aſſent of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to reject a Greater Good, for the ſake of a Leſs; 'tis odds, but in time he may learn, even for the ſame Reaſon, to throw off his ſmall Reſidue of Good, and ſo plunge himſelf totally into Vice. For that part of Good, which he firſt refuſed, was equally as good as the Remainder, which he may alſo as eaſily part withal. Wherefore we muſt both early and diligently watch againſt all ſorts of Depravity: For a preſent Sin makes way for a Future; and every Sin we commit makes a Link of that Iron-Chain, by which we are ty'd down to inextricable Sorrow, and to Darkneſs that will have no End.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. THE third Rule is, <hi>That whatever Work we ſet about, let it appear we do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Virtue in the doing of it.</hi> There is a double Manner of proceeding in every Buſineſs, not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100094:113"/> only a Right Way and a Wrong: but a Gentle and a Rough; a Violent Way and a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Wherefore 'tis of no ſmall Moment, in the courſe of our Life to hit upon the Beſt; and that commonly is the Beſt, which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours moſt of Moderation, Grace and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. FOURTHIY, <hi>That we do by Ardent Prayers contend, that God would pour into us a ſufficiency of ſtrength, for the Acquiſition of Virtue.</hi> No Mortal ought to be aſham'd to Beg, and to accept from Him ſo Divine a Gift, from whom he had alſo his Being. For we dare Affirm, that whoever pretends to Virtue, without Imploring it at God's Hand, will only catch the empty Shadow thereof. thereof. <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerv'd, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>That no Man could be Great, but as Illuminated by ſome Ray, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd by ſome Breath from Heaven.</hi> And if nothing be of a more Heavenly Nature than Virtue, 'tis then impoſſible to have it without the Help of God.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. NOR muſt any Man wonder, that we annex Prayers unto <hi>Moral Philoſophy;</hi> ſince we have already made Piety an Eſſential part thereof. <hi>Epictetus, Plato, Antoninus,</hi> and other Philoſophers, have done the like. And here let us obſerve the words of <hi>Hierocles,</hi> who has in this Part exceeded the reſt, <hi>'Tis not enough</hi> (ſays he) <hi>with Promptitude and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, to enterprize that which is Laudable, <note place="margin">In Aurea Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina.</note> as if the ſucceſs were wholly in our Power, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need of aſſiſtance from God. No, we muſt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100094:114"/> Implore the Divine Aid; and not onely Implore it, but endeavour alſo to Obtain by our Induſtry, what we ask in our Prayer. For otherwiſe we make Virtue as it were a ſharer in Atheiſm and Hypocriſie; or elſe render our own Prayers Inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. The firſt of which by its Impiety would take away the very Eſſence of Virtue, and the latter by Stupidity would extinguiſh the Nature of Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us hereunto add that ſaying out of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> mentioned by <hi>Xenophon, <note place="margin">Xenophon de Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticâ.</note> That every Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſhould begin with a Recommendation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Gods;</hi> and that of <hi>Cicero, That the Riſe and Source of all our Actions be founded with the Immortal Gods.</hi> Likewiſe that of <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus, <note place="margin">

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100094:114"/> Virtue; but we own, that 'tis God onely, that can Bleſs, and Crown all our Endeavours for it with Succeſs.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. HOWEVER 'tis not here underſtood, that thoſe are the moſt Efficacious Prayers which are the Longeſt, or the Loudeſt, or the moſt Eloquent; but rather thoſe ſhort and frequent Ejaculations, which the Soul, after long and convincing thoughtfulneſs, ſends up to Heaven: Such, I mean, as are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſighs and a vehement Yerning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God and Virtue. For by ſuch pious Anxiety, we exerciſe and rarifie the Blood and Spirits; we pour into them new ſupplies of pure and hallow'd Air; we corroborate and augment our inward Sentiments of Heaven, and ſend up our Prayers, as in a Chariot of Light or Fire. So that as, in theſe fervent and holy Pantings, we do (in a ſort) draw God into the Soul; we do, in like manner, breath back nothing but that which is Celeſtial and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. THE fifth and laſt Precept is that of <hi>Pythagoras, That we fail not every Night, before we take Reſt, to ſum up the Actions of the paſt Day.</hi> Thus if we have done any thing well, we may give God the thanks and glory of it: But, if otherwiſe, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the Miſdoing, and by this means daily fix and ſettle in our minds a reſolution of acting in every thing according to the moſt perfect Rule of Virtue.

That ſo we may behold it naked and intire, and what it is in its whole Eſſence, and in every Part.</hi> And this ſurely is the great Buſineſs of <hi>Prudence.</hi> For how elſe are Men carry'd away, or come to be diſappointed, in what they ſhould avoid or purſue; but for not looking round, and not taking into conſideration both the Whole and the Parts? They catch things at firſt ſight, and from ſome few parts, which <hi>Pleaſe</hi> or <hi>Diſpleaſe,</hi> determine the Fate of all the reſt. Thus they become very groſs Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countants; For while they compute and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt up what in bulk or value is but part of the Thing (as if it were the whole) they are not capable of Judging; and only diſcover that Precipitation is the Root of moſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
                  <p>It were good therefore, to obſerve the Advice that <hi>Epictetus</hi> gave him who was ſo very intent to conquer at the <hi>Olympic</hi> Games: Namely, <hi>That he ſhould well revolve in his Mind, what things were Antecedent, and what Conſequent to that Enterpriſe; and then ſtick
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100094:116"/> cloſe to the Work.</hi> And to this belongs what he adds in the following Chapter, <hi>O Man, firſt conſider what the Work is, and then thy own Nature, if thou art able to ſupport it.</hi> For if theſe be not adjuſted, we ſhall quickly paſs as vain Projectors, repenting that we ever ſet forth, and ſharing in the Contempts and ſcorns of the Unfortunate.</p>
                  <p>To this kind of Prudence we may refer that moſt Excellent Admonition of <hi>Epichar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Be thou ſober, and remember to Diſtruſt; For theſe Things are the very Nerves of Wiſdom.</hi> And, as conſonant hereunto, let us add this Advice of our own, <hi>Never much to believe either Fortune or Men: but to truſt in God and Virtue which can never Change.</hi> For Men dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, in a few Days, even from themſelves; and their Wills and Counſels are not to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſame.</p>

For does any Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us neglect a Benefactor to his Face? Do we not rather load him with Honours, and make our Acknowledgments as profound, and as anſwerable to his Bounties, as we can? How then ſhall we put that upon God, which even among Men is not permitted without Shame? This alone, unto a generous Mind is motive enough, and a ſufficient Spur unto <hi>Piety.</hi> But for others, let them take warning, leſt by Ingratitude they forfeit all Title to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100094:118"/> Let them, in time, conſider that Divine Vengeance will be as diligent to find them out, as they are now drouzy and regardleſs towards their Creator. Yet as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worſhip, let this be a Rule to all, that we ſo adhere to God's outward and publick Service; as not to omit our inward and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions, which are certainly the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part.</p>

                  <p n="3">III. BUT, having quoted thus much, let us not omit what the ſame Author more elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at large, ſets forth: to wit, <hi>That the wiſe Man is the onely Prieſt; He onely is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, and He onely knows how to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. For he onely knows how to Worſhip God aright, who is arrived to Divine Knowledge; He, I ſay, that offers himſelf for a Sacrifice; that converts his Soul into a Divine Monument; and whoſe Mind is prepar'd as a Temple, for the reception of Heavenly Light.</hi> Here 'tis to be obſerv'd that the Man whom <hi>Hierocles</hi> calls <hi>Wiſe, Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Prudent.</hi> But both are in reality the ſame, as being endow'd with Virtue: For Virtue, which is true and rais'd up to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and which becomes thereby the Image of God, is certainly God's beſt Worſhip. Yet this Inward Gift never contends againſt thoſe Rites and Forms in Religion, that are decent and eſtabliſht by Law.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. As to the other Branch of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which is <hi>Probity;</hi> and commonly call'd by the Name of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in a ſtricter Senſe: This ought to be much in the care of all pious Men, as 'tis a Branch of that Piety, which is a principal part of Virtue; and which had been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated (in our <hi>Second Book</hi>) to be the beſt way of God's Worſhip. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.</note> For <hi>Probity</hi> is the Bond of Society, and of all Human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; and the whole World is in a manner ſo ty'd together and ſupported by it, that if this Pillar were ſhaken, the ruin of all muſt follow. Wherefore all Men are bound
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100094:119"/> to defend it, and to regard it even as an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Thing.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. BUT if any Man who for barely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining himſelf within the bounds of Human Law, ſhall thereupon pretend unto the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Juſt;</hi> we ſhall venture to call this rather <hi>Dexterity</hi> or Artifice, than true <hi>Juſtice.</hi> For ſuch an one feels no Concern as to the Publick Good; his thoughts are all about him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and <hi>Juſtice</hi> (which conſults the good of others) has no part in his Meditations; ſince they are bounded and limited by Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love. So that if a Man of this frame ſhould but live to ſee the Laws laid by, he would ſtart immediately into another ſhape. He, who but yeſterday was according to the letter of the Law, a very preciſe Elder, turns ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Libertine,</hi> or as ravenous as an Evening Wolf. Wherefore let him, who deſires to be truly Juſt, not believe that he is already ſo; unleſs he finds that, if there were no Laws, he could contain himſelf, and ſtill be Maſter of the ſame Deſires.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. As to <hi>Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> we may here repeat what before we offer'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Patience. Hierocles</hi> calls them all, <hi>The Adamantine keepers of the Soul:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In Aurea Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina.</note> If you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them, ſhe preſently is betray'd to all Temptations and Calamity. But how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>Fortitude</hi> is, will appear by that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſaying of <hi>Andronicus:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</note> Namely, <hi>That ſome things are ſo Diſhoneſt, as not to afford the Ill-doer the leaſt ſhadow or pretence of Excuſe.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100094:119"/> And therefore that a Man muſt vigorouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things, and not onely indure Terment on ſuch account, but even immediate Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore there is no Argument that more helps a Man to ſtudy <hi>Fortitude,</hi> and how to acquire it; than to conſider how miſerable we are without it; 'tis elſe in the power of every inſolent Superior, either by Threats or by Oppreſſion, to make the timorous Man as vile and as obſequious as he pleaſes. And what greater torment or ſervitude can there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to an ingenuous Mind, than (with Guilt and Confuſion) to own, that, as ſoon as the terror of any great miſchief looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; he ſhall not onely ſhrink from Truth and Virtue, but even contribute to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them both.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. As for <hi>Intemperance,</hi> the very Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of that Pleaſure were enough to deter us from it. He that conſiders the Dignity of Man, and the great things he is born to, muſt be aſtoniſh'd to ſee, at how mean a rate he often ſells them all! The poor Fly is not more eaſily taken in the Cobweb, or the Fiſh deluded by the Bait, or any other Beaſt fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in a Toil, than is poor Man, whom luſts and paſſions have ſubdu'd. Every <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine</hi> calls him away, and every impure Raſcal leads him about; till at laſt he grows abject and more contemptible than a Beaſt. For Pleaſure, which feeds and vitiates the Senſe, does alſo by degrees prey upon the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100094:120"/> Mind: It puts out the Light, and breaks the force it had. Nay, when at laſt nothing but <hi>Fortitude</hi> is left him (that Sentinel, or Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, without whoſe vigor and fidelity no virtue can be ſafe) even here Pleaſure at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks him, and like a raging Strumpet that has had ſucceſs, comes on with Impudence, and will not quit her Hold, till ſhe drives us into utter deſtruction. So that what <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, is no leſs true than common, <note place="margin">De Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctute.</note> 
                     <hi>That, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Pleaſure, it was impoſſible for Men to hold any Commerce with Virtue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. NOR does <hi>Intemperance</hi> onely benumb and bewitch the Mind; but the Body alſo is miſerably ſhaken and obnoxious to many cruel Diſeaſes by it: So that <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> even on Health's account, deſerves our higheſt Care. 'Tis not that here we ſhould aſſign the Weights and Meaſures of <hi>Temperance,</hi> but onely ſpeak of what is relative to Health, and to the good ſtate of the Body and the Mind; Since we know that in robuſt Bodies, which are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, the faculties of the Mind are very often incumbred, and oppreſt.</p>

                  <p n="10">X. THIS then is true and <hi>Philoſophical Temperance,</hi> if we ſo far ſubdue the bulk and powers of the Body, as that they may not be able to ſtifle or extenuate the Senſe of excellent Things. And above all, <hi>That the Internal Spirit be not pamper'd and incraſſated,</hi> which is what <hi>Hierocles</hi> calls the <hi>Spiritual Vehicle.</hi> His Opinion being, <hi>That our Internal Man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and made up, as well of this, Vehicle as of the Soul.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> made great work about the <hi>purifying of the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Vehicle,</hi> as by the following words of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi> appears: <note place="margin">In Aurea Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina.</note>

But the care of this Purification muſt extend even to Meats and Drinks, and whatever elſe concerns theſe our Mortal Bodies. For the Luciform Spirit reſides therein; it was that which gave Life to this, when it was ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate, and is the Conſervator of its preſent Frame. This indeed is that Immaterial Body, which is Life it ſelf, and which gives and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates material Life; 'Tis by this that our Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bodies, which conſiſt of Life Irrational and Body Material, are made up: And thus an Image is compos'd of the Internal Man, who is built out of Rational Subſtance, and Body Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</hi>

IN all which High Words, he intimates, that in our care concerning the <hi>External Man,</hi> which is our <hi>Corporeal Frame</hi> or <hi>Bulk,</hi> we muſt be ſure to bring no Detriment or Contagion to the Internal: But that the regulation and meaſures of our Diet as to meat and drink, and what elſe concerns this Mortal Body, muſt refer to the health or ſafety of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man. The End being, that this Thin and Lucid covering of the Soul, which muſt ſurely be ſome Aerial or Ethereal Veſtment, be kept free from all ſervile Commixtures with our polluted Carcaſe. And hereto the ſame <hi>Hierocles</hi> adds, <hi>That foraſmuch as to this our Luciform Body, there is another Mortal Body congenerate and affix'd; We are to preſerve the former in all Purity, and to diſcharge it (as much as is poſſible) from all Intercommoning or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations with the Latter.</hi>

                  <p n="12">XII. THE truth is, that all this Doctrine about Cleanſing and Purgation even of the Soul it ſelf (and ſo the whole Buſineſs and Import of Virtue) points but at this, that there be Cleanlineſs in the Inward Man, and that the vigor of it be ſuſtain'd. For ſo the ſame great Interpreter of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does a while after explain the Matter, ſaying, <hi>That the purification of the rational Soul, was done with concern, and had reference to the Luciform Vehicle; Meaning that the Vehicle was thereby to be render'd more Lightſom and Elaſtic, ſo as it might not afterwards retard the ſuperiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100094:121"/> was beſt effected, by divorcing our Thoughts and Meditations from Terrene Objects, and lifting them by degrees unto things Immaterial. That all Turpitude was to be ſuppreſs'd; and that we ſhould prohibit all ſordid Intercourſe of the Body Material, for fear the Luciform Body ſhould be Tarniſh'd and contaminated by it. That if there were a Vigilance in theſe Particulars, then might this Spiritual Vehicle acquire new Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor; it might be endow'd with Celeſtial Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and at length enter into a Conjugation with the Intellectual Perfections of the Soul.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>All this can Purification do, when but ſteer'd and conducted by Virtue; It can Recollect, Reſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate, and even inſpire with heavenly Energy, that ſubtile and attenuated Chariot of our Mind; that inward Organ, which will afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main its Habitacle, and a Conſort inſeparable to all Eternity.</hi>

I confeſs, theſe things ſound as lofty Flights, and yet they are the Documents of the famous <hi>Hierocles;</hi> by which we are taught, that the greateſt pitch of Philoſophical <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> is, <hi>To preſerve this Vehicle</hi> in a congruous temper to the purity of the Soul; that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man</hi> be not defil'd by the Senſe of Groſs Contentments; Not impotently hurry'd on to concur with Fleſh and Blood; nor anxious for Joys that have no manner of Foundation.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Liberality</hi> is not to be neglected: Since, on the one Hand, we ſhew thereby, that our Souls are not contracted to the bare admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wealth; Nor our Minds, on the other hand, ſo ſtupid, as not to underſtand the true Uſe and Ends thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnificence</hi> is prais'd by its own works; ſince theſe bring Benefit to the Publick, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to the World, and Variety to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the Time.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. VERACITY muſt be our conſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and Companion: For 'tis the worſt of Characters to be a noted Lyar. There is no Quickſand, or infected Air, more frightful to the Traveller, nor any Wizzard more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be met withal, than an accompliſh'd
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100094:123"/> Lyar. He will lead you, like a Ghoſt, into dangerous Paths; and, when you are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring quite out of your Way, he will be ſure to leave you in the Dark.</p>
                  <p>However, 'tis ſtrange to ſee how the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in this Talent, will yet ſet up for Men of <hi>Prudence.</hi> They are indeed wiſe enough to know that every Vice muſt bear a virtuous Name; and that Fraud and Cunning, will never ſtand alone. 'Tis as with Strumpets, who affect to be ſeen at Church among the Matrons: but as they are the more abhorr'd herein for their Impudence, as well as Vice; ſo ought it be with theſe plauſible Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors. There is even a Sect of theſe, who alſo ſet up for Wits; they think there can be no greater Excellency than in the way call'd <hi>Bantering:</hi> Surely the Man muſt be very dull, that cannot Deceive, if he but reſolve to Lye. Yet as he that will deceive when he can, ſhews a Mind that is vile and abject: So the truly prudent and generous Man, is he that will be Honeſt in the dark: He that will be as juſt, when 'tis in his power to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as if it were not. But whoever notes the Events of things ſhall ſee, that Knaves and Hypocrites are expos'd to ſhame, and end their Lives obſcurely; whereas the juſt and vertuous ſort endure, and their Reputation ſtill ſhines forth as at the Noon-day. Every counterfeit thing muſt be ſhort-liv'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fidelity</hi> is much to be cultivated; and how could Human Society conſiſt without it: ſince
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100094:124"/> to keep Promiſes, and to reſtore what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited with us, are the Top-branches and conſpicuous parts of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence alſo we may be convinc'd how much it imports us to conſider well of <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> For every good turn done us is, as it were a Pledg depoſited in our truſt and keeping: And ſurely he that repays it not back, as ſoon as he can, is guilty of <hi>Infidelity.</hi> Nay, <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> is ſo remarkable a part of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that whoever has the heart to violate this Bond, is thought capable (might he do it with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity) of trampling on all the Laws of the World. Now who would incur this Character, or draw himſelf under ſo diſmal a Guilt? There is certainly no Monſter that a Man ſhould more abhor, than this Monſter of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. As to the ſhew and expreſſion of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> in our Converſe with Men, there are great Motives for it. Firſt, Becauſe the Errors of moſt Men are Errors of Ignorance: and yet, even among theſe Errors, their Minds often labour to bring forth Truth and good Works; a Birth which indeed we ought kindly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, by interpreting favourably all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and affording them the very beſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances we can. For we do, by this ſoft Temper, help on Peace, and the cementing of Men's Minds towards a bond of Unity: which is ſo worthy a part, that all Men ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it.</p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:100094:124"/>
                  <p n="4">IV. FOR <hi>Urbanity,</hi> we muſt not be ſo Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, as not to hear and bear the Jeſts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (and ſometimes tart ones too) altho we are not good at Jeſting our ſelves. In truth, he that is dexterous in Raillery, has found a Remedy to laugh away his Labour, and a very good Sauce againſt the fatigues of Life. For tho it was not Nature's Intention, to fit us onely for Sport and Paſtime; Yet theſe, doubtleſs, are lawful in their ſeaſons, juſt as ſleep, and other Refreſhments, to the Body and the Mind: provided always that things of Moment are not obſtructed by them. 'Tis to this ſenſe that <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks in his <hi>Offices, That the ways of Jeſting are very different: the one, Sawey, Ruſtic, Impious, and Obſcene; the other, Elegant, Candid, Ingenuous, and Pleaſant.</hi> And ſurely, 'tis this laſt which is recommended to us. However, if ſomething herein ſhould drop, ſo quick and pleaſing to the Company as to cauſe Laughter for the ſmart which it reflects; he that feels it (being a good Man) will not ſo much vex to ſee, that ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are inſulted over, as have cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, that his greater Virtues are at the ſame time applauded: For he hears the worſt that can be ſaid of him, ſince Adverſaries are ſtill known to ſhoot their longeſt and ſharpeſt Arrows. And here we refer to what (in our <hi>Firſt Book</hi>) was ſaid of the <hi>Interpretation of Paſſions;</hi> which may farther illuſtrate this Point. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. § 2. 3.</note> But if ſome rude and ill-natur'd Man ſhall perhaps bear-over-hard upon us, and both jeſt
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100094:125"/> and ſting together; We muſt then do what we can, to cure the ſubject matter, and draw out that Core, in which his Darts are fix'd.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. MODESTY muſt attend all our Actions; 'tis the Flower, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. §. 11.</note> the Beauty of <hi>Jeſutice,</hi> and even its chief Perfection: This we have already ſet forth, and it needs not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Humanity</hi> does challenge a moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal regard among all the other Virtues. We are all, as it were, linked in one common chain of Equality; nor is one man to think himſelf ſo very preferable to another; when, in things of Paſſion and of Reaſon, in Death and Immortality, we ſeem all to ſhare alike. He therefore that contemns another, and forgets that way of Treatment, which <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> demands, he ſeems to give Sentence againſt himſelf. For 'twill be as lawful at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time, and when Circumſtances are alike, to refuſe to him thoſe common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites of Human Nature; ſeeing in his turn he refuſed them to others. So that whoever arrogates to himſelf a great Preheminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Fellow-Creatures, does but expoſe his Vanity, and takes pains to be Ridiculous. Let no man, of how mean a Condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if he be a good Man, and has not by his Follies loſt all Title to the Rights of Human Nature, be treated with Contumely. 'Tis the ſaying of <hi>Heraclitus, Enter, Gentlemen, even here the Gods inhabit:</hi> Which may truly be ſaid of the pooreſt Man living, ſo that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100094:125"/> his Heart be but ſound and Juſt. For (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Prerogative, which is common to Mankind) ſuch an one ſhould be regarded with Love and Tenderneſs, and as it were ſome Creature that were even Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. FOR <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> it will ſtand leſs in need of Recommendation, as 'tis a manifeſt part of <hi>Humanity.</hi> It ſeems to be moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful there, where Strangers are liable to be ill us'd by the Natives, and where they want the things of Accommodation they were us'd to find at Home. Theſe therefore we ſhould ſtrive to Help and Succour, in all they can need at our Hands: Not forgetting that even Holy Angels are thus employ'd, whom we ought to imitate. For they, during this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pilgrimage of our Souls; do ſeaſonably ſtep in, both to relieve and ſuccour us, when we are moſt diſtreſs'd.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. FOR what concerns <hi>Friendſhip</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> theſe are carefully to be Acquir'd; and not barely as Ornaments, but as Bulwarks in Human Life. If you light on ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your fervent Love; place it rather on their Virtues, than their Perſons, which are both mutable and mortal. Let not your <hi>Friendſhip</hi> conſiſt, in ſoft and unprofitable ſtrains; nor in vehemency of Paſſion, which would bring many a ſtorm and diſorder to your Mind. But let the Character of it be <hi>Sincere</hi> and <hi>Conſtant,</hi> and ſuch as fulfills all the Duties appertaining thereto, with a chearful and officious Benignity.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:100094:126"/>
                  <p n="8">VIII. LASTLY, As to <hi>Civility, Affability,</hi> and <hi>Officiouſneſs;</hi> theſe are all to be regarded, not onely as Credentials, which procure us Fame and good Will: but they very often become the very Eſſential Knots of that Peace and Friendſhip which we enjoy. Therefore let no Man neglect, and much leſs deſpiſe theſe ſmaller Virtues; which often, as ſmaller Wires, ſuſtain much weight. We do by them live more pleaſantly among our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; our ſecurity becomes the greater and our Favour and Credit with Men is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by increas'd. And who wou'd not wear ſuch things about him, as make him welcom where-e'er he comes, and coſt him nothing the Carriage?</p>

                  <p>'TIS the praiſe of <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> that is does not diſquiet the Mind with minute or nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cares; but rather lifts it up to the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of doing great and excellent things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the number can be but ſmall. They that know the Dignity of Humane Nature, and what it is capable of, think it loſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to be ingag'd in Trifles. So that as nothing is higher or greater than God and Virtue, 'tis in the Veneration of theſe Objects, our Minds and Wills are by this Virtue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d and underprop'd; And by it we are alſo reclaim'd, from wandring into things which are but mean and vulgar.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, what we did before attribute unto <hi>Magnificence,</hi> is equally applicable to this Virtue: Namely, that the great Acts and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements hereof, redound to the ſervice of the Publick; and adorn both the World and the Chronicles of the Age.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. THE benefit and prefection of <hi>Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> appears in this, that a Man is not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd herein by popular Applauſe, or the Itch of common Glory; but acting ſincerely and with Conſcience, towards Virtue and true Beatitude, his Mind is ſatisfi'd and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in his Work. Nay, altho the Malice and Clamour of all Mankind were broke looſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yet he will ſtand firm to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and maintain Truth with an unſhaken Courage.</p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:100094:127"/>
                  <p>'Tis very true that often, in the purſuit of Virtue; as well the deſire of Fame and Glory, as the fear of Shame and Reproach, have their benefit and Effects. But when Virtue is once attain'd, and that we are in the actual poſſeſſion thereof, then thoſe things are but as mere Scaffolding, to be remov'd or burnt.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. THIS Virtue is therefore of the more high Account, as it is the true Guardian and Sentinel upon all the reſt. It ſhould eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be cultivated by young Men, whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, or an honeſt Ambition, has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to excel their Fellows. For the blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Men, and the Vicious, make a ſtrong Party in the World, and they conſpire how to ſcoff the Induſtrious out of Countenance. And it comes to paſs that many a Good-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Man is by ſhame run down, and laugh'd into a compliance with thoſe things, which yet he does inwardly deteſt. But let ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Candidates remember, that if this Trick could have prevail'd on all that went before them, never had any Man been Eminent, or attain'd to Glory: That as it is ſtout both to bear, and even ſcorn at, Reproach for Virtue's ſake; ſo it is mean and cowardly, to humour thoſe, who either craftily tempt, or haughtily expect, that you make up part of their Train in their unlawful ways. There want not, in the World, Companions and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates of a better ſtamp, tho not ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or ſo eaſily met with in the Streets:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100094:127"/> but they are worth the ſearching for. And as to the other ſort of Men, who are ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as to become mere Advocates for things that are Vile: Remember, in ſhort, the better advice of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>—Summè reverere Teipſum.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. LENITY, or a Calmneſs of Mind, is even in this Regard extremely valuable, that it is a ſort of Buckler againſt the Scoffs and Injuries of all Men. This was noted by <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> in that Famous Saying, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. §. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>That Lenity was an Invincible Thing, provided it were Genuin, and not Counterfeit, as ſome grave Scorners make it.</hi> No Shield is ſo avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Mind's Tranquillity, as is this Calmneſs, and true Lenity: Nor does any thing require it, or ſupport it more, than to reflect that few Men ever offend us either in word or deed, but it ariſes from their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Wherefore the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Socrates,</hi> were wont of ſuch men to ſay, <hi>Sic ille opinatur;</hi> ſuch is his Opinion. And <hi>omnis improbus ignorat,</hi> A wicked man knows not what he does.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. CONSTANCY we muſt have; for elſe we ſhall ſeem to act at hazard; and to have neither Reaſon nor Virtue for our Guide.

                  <p>But he that is now Good, and then Bad, is not govern'd by ſteady Principles, but the laſt Impreſſion governs him.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. LASTLY, <hi>Diligence</hi> is a certain chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant or Sollicitor, that attends upon all the other Virtues, and muſt therefore be careſs'd. We may call it even the Maſter and Moderator of all our External Actions; Inaſmuch as it knows how to excite our Bodies, and all the parts thereof, to ſuch Activity, as the duty and buſineſs of our Life requires.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. THE Reſidue of thoſe Virtues, which refer to <hi>Fortitude,</hi> have ſo cloſe an Affinity with theſe, which we here explain, that it were needleſs to ſet them off with any new Teſtimonial. For they are as the very Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Diligence, Conſtancy,</hi> or <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Acquiring thoſe Virtues, which refer to <hi>Temperance;</hi> And about exciting the Divine Love.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. THERE are Referable unto <hi>Temperance, Frugality, Humility, Auſterity, Modeſty. Andronicus</hi> alſo adds <hi>Slender and uncompounded Diet, Umblameable Geſture;</hi> and, <hi>A Contented Mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which that about <hi>Slender-Diet</hi> and <hi>Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> are as it were the Sorts and Methods of <hi>Frugality:</hi> even as that of <hi>Geſture</hi> is of <hi>Modeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. FRUGALITY has this Commendation, that 'tis the Parent, or at leaſt the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Sobriety; As alſo a Cure againſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and Poverty. 'Tis attended by Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Prudence; leſt that, ſpending profuſely and living beyond our Stocks, we be diſabled not onely from entertaining our Friends in a frugal way, but driven to live wholly upon them: which of all Conditions were the moſt miſerable. So that, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation hereof, we may affirm, that true <hi>Frugality</hi> has an Eye unto Generoſity it ſelf; and that there is an Honeſt Greatneſs of the Soul, concern'd in the true Conduct of this Virtue.</p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:100094:129"/>
                  <p n="3">III. THE ſame Reflection is fortifi'd by what <hi>Andronicus</hi> ſays of thoſe bordering Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that refer to this. For he, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with eaſie Food, and has no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Sauce or Cookery, is much out of Fortune's reach, and does not eaſily fall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Injuries of Men. This Virtue ſets him as in a Tower above others, and he is ſeldom captivated by any: For as it is God alone, that needeth nothing; ſo he that is contented with feweſt things, approaches neareſt unto him.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. IN the next place, <hi>Auſterity</hi> or <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> together with <hi>Modeſty</hi> and the Virtues ally'd thereto, are to be had in much Regard: For they do not onely adorn our Life and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Behaviour,</hi> but really preſerve the Mind both chaſt and unblemiſh'd. The firſt glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of Vice, and that very ſhadow that begins to play in the Imagination, is by thoſe Virtues not onely reprehended, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſmother'd and ſuppreſs'd.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. YET is there no ſort of Virtue more to be purſu'd than <hi>Humility:</hi> Since there are no two Plagues ſo deſtructive in Human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as are thoſe of <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Avarice.</hi> Hence ariſe Treachery to Friends and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Maſſacre of Princes, Deſertion of Truth and Religion, Frauds (not to be nam'd) both againſt God and Virtue; In ſhort, All, that can ſpawn from Injuſtice, hath its Original from this Source. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may well be doubted, Whether the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100094:129"/> fear of torment on a Rack, or of Death it ſelf, have ſo much power to drive Men into Impiety, as that inordinate Thirſt, which ſome diſcover in the purſuit of Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Domination? Conſequently, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even <hi>Fortitude</hi> it ſelf be ſo ſtrong a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark as Humility proves? By which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, as into a Harbor, where the noiſe and ſtorms of the World fly over us; and where we are neither tempted, nor diſtracted with the dazling vanities thereof.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. THE word <hi>Humility</hi> ſounds low, and may ſeem deſpicable among the Virtues: Yet is it ſo conſpicuous a branch of true and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Wiſdom, that even <hi>Lucretius</hi> (who did not much trouble himſelf in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) was not barely acquainted with it, but has very Elegantly painted it out, in the Verſes following:<note place="margin">

That is, That we be not drawn to that which may pleaſe our ſelves or the deareſt Friends whatever, on any ſenſual Account; but to conſult our Conſcience, Whether the matter in Queſtion be laudable and juſt, and then to purſue it with Faith and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi>

                  <p n="10">X. THUS you have, what we judg'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for acquiring of Virtue, as well in particular as in the general. Wherefore let us cloſe all with that ſhort Document of <hi>Pythagoras:</hi> who adviſes thus, <hi>That we fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently embrace and wed theſe Things; That we frequently meditate upon them; That we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently put them into practice; For theſe will at length ſo eſtabliſh our Feet in the paths of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Virtue, as never to ſlide or ſtumble, and never to deviate, or be ejected from them.</hi> And ſurely to attain this Perfection in Virtue, is to attain the moſt perfect Happineſs, that Man's Nature is capable of.</p>
                  <p>It now onely remains, that we ſpeak of Acquiring that Part, which conſiſteth in <hi>External Good.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Acquiſition of <hi>External Good.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">I. WE have already explain'd, how very ſmall a proportion of <hi>External Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> are abſolutely needful to <hi>Man's Happineſs.</hi> It now remains to inquire, If <hi>Happineſs</hi> can (in any ſort) appear more perfect and exalted, by the addition of all that we have ſtyled <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bleſſings:</hi> Inaſmuch as Moral Virtues
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100094:132"/> may not a little contribute to the Acquiſition of them all.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. WE ſhall firſt repeat the chief of them; and then ſhew how ſome Virtues, if not all, do help to compaſs either the very <hi>Bleſſings themſelves,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> or at leaſt <hi>Things Equivalent</hi> to them, and ſuch as perhaps we ought juſtly to value beyond them.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. AS for the firſt two great Branches herein; namely, the advantages of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and of the <hi>Body,</hi> 'Tis manifeſt that Virtue bids fair even to their particular Acquiſition, or at leaſt to their augmenting and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This appears firſt in reference to the Soul, as in the <hi>Subtilty</hi> and <hi>Dexterity</hi> of Wit, Fidelity and Vaſtneſs of the Memory: Alſo in <hi>Science, Art,</hi> and <hi>Sapience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For is there any thing in Nature can more contribute to theſe Bleſſings, than that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Temperance, we have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd? When, on the other ſide, 'tis as plain, that the ſharpeſt Wit in the World, grows blunt, and is made even ſtupid, by Luxury and Exceſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. LOOK upon <hi>Memory,</hi> and obſerve how ſtrangely 'tis fortify'd by <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance!</hi> How 'tis extended by Exerciſe, which is the fruit of <hi>Diligence!</hi> But by <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,</hi> or by <hi>Luſt,</hi> or <hi>Drowſineſs,</hi> or <hi>Neglect,</hi> it withers, and comes to nothing.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. 'TIS true, that neither Virtue, nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals do promote us in Mechanical Arts, or indeed in Natural Philoſophy, or the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100094:133"/> But conſider, I pray, how far theſe contribute towards <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Memory!</hi> How great the Power of <hi>Diligence</hi> is towards every Attempt! And 'tis manifeſt that, for getting the Mathematicks, there muſt be a certain <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> to adapt a Man to that Study.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. BUT the Higheſt Gift of all Moral Philoſophy, muſt ever be allow'd to be that <hi>Prudence,</hi> which has been ſo accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd already; and which has certainly a marvellous influence, as well upon all Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Habits, as for the acquiring of <hi>True Wiſdom.</hi> And her inſeparable Conſort is that <hi>Philoſophical Temperance,</hi> we have ſpoken of before.</p>
                  <p>Let no Man hope, without theſe two Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ever to attain the knowledg of <hi>Things Divine,</hi> which is the onely <hi>Sapience</hi> or <hi>True Wiſdom.</hi> For, as <hi>Plato</hi> has it in his <hi>Phaedo, What Pretence can the Impure Man have, to the things that are Pure.</hi> And whereas the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher was there contending, as if no Man could obtain pure and ſincere Virtue, that had not firſt laid by his Body; What ſhall we ſay of thoſe, who think much to ſhake off, but the very Filth and Vices of their Bodies? Men, that think a little Induſtry, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſeverance of the Mind, will find out Truth, without any neceſſity of parting with their darling Crimes? But whether this be not the voice of a Fool, or of a mad Man, is not hard to determine.</p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:100094:133"/>
                  <p n="7">VII. WHOEVER can be Faulty in this kind, appears to me, as a Bleer-Ey'd Man; whom nothing will content, but to be gazing at things diſtant, and to ſee them both clearly and diſtinctly. He refuſes all Remedy for his Eyes, but reſolves by obſtinate and perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory ſtaring to find out the Mark. Thus he goes on, till, inſtead of ſeeing better, he every Day grows more blind: Whereas, if he conſulted the Rules of <hi>Prudence</hi> and of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> he would know both the Neceſſity, and the way, of firſt curing his Sight.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Is there any Man living has Self-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency enough to Contemplate God, the Soul's Immortality, and Divine Providence? Or to conſider of theſe things ſolidly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dately, without ſome ſort of Separation or Abſtraction of the Soul from the Body? That is to ſay, in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Style, <hi>Without ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of Death, as ſeems to divorce us from Corporeal Affections?</hi> Or, can any Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſuch Tranſlation, be (as it were) rapt up into that State of <hi>Divine Love,</hi> which can onely fit him for Truth, and expound the Oracles and Myſteries of things, which are otherwiſe Inſcrutable? For by how much all Senſual and Corporeal Impreſſions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd in us, by the application of that <hi>Prudence,</hi> and of that <hi>Philoſophical Temperance</hi> we have mention'd; by ſo much do we grow Citizens of that Intellectual World, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the Regions of Heavenly Light.</p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:100094:134"/>
                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>Sapience,</hi> or the knowledg of Divine Myſteries, is the true Off-ſpring of that Virtue, which is entire, abſolute, and conſummated.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. As to thoſe Bleſſings which refer <hi>to the Body,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Strength, Agility, Health,</hi> and <hi>Comlineſs.</hi> 'Tis true that <hi>Strength</hi> is not ſo much the Gift of Virtue as of Nature; tho 'tis as true, that the preſervation of it is owing to Virtue. Nay, 'tis not improbable, but that a Body, in declination of Health, may, by hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, exerciſe, and ſome Fatigue, become more vigorous and robuſt.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Agility:</hi> This may not onely be as the Pupil, but even the Child of Virtue: Since <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> do commonly wear down the bulk and excreſcence of the Body, and rather furniſh a Stock of Spirits, than of Fleſh. In which caſe, <hi>Agility</hi> muſt ſucceed of courſe.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. BUT the moſt high and conſpicuous gift of Virtue, is that of <hi>Bodily Health;</hi> which as it may be owing in part to every Virtue: ſo more eſpecially to <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> I think it was the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Oracle did thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce;
<q>
                        <l>Ad Pietatis Opus vegetum ſi extenderis Ignem</l>
                        <l>Mentis, &amp; hos fluxos ſanabis corporis Artus.</l>
                     </q>
                     <q>
                        <l>Would you the beſt Phyſician find</l>
                        <l>For a craz'd Body, or afflicted Mind?</l>
                        <l>Try what the power of Piety can do,</l>
                        <l>It heals the Mind, and cures the Body too.</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:100094:134"/> For a purifi'd Mind goes a great way to the purging and purifying of the Body: it darts upon it ſome Rays, which have great effect, and which corroborate the powers thereof. Whereas, if the Soul be taken up by conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cares and Cupidities; If Hatred and Malice make all things ghaſtly and ſour within: How can it be, but that the Body muſt alſo droop, the Health wither, and the Force decline?</p>
                  <p>If therefore ſuch Dilapidations can ariſe from the remote impreſſions of the Mind; What will not thoſe more immediate ſtrokes accompliſh; I mean, Eating long, and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deep and daily, and the inſolence of an ungovernable Luſt?</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. THE Diſeaſes of the Body are, for the moſt part, from the Vices of the Mind; and even the Off-ſpring of ſinful Parents do often inherit their Infirmities, as well as their Acres. But there is no Remedy ſo powerful, for ſuch an Incumbrance, as a ſevere application to Virtue and Piety. For as Juſtice had a Being before all the Vices of the Mind; ſo was Health more ancient than all the Sickneſſes of the Body. Thus is one brought in, by <hi>Maximus Tyrius,</hi> to pray, <hi>O Health, the moſt Ancient of all the other Goddeſſes; What wou'd I give to enjoy thee, but the little remainder of my days!</hi> Certainly, no Man can better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſuch a Wiſh, than he who is ſincerely Vertuous and Devout.</p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:100094:135"/>
                  <p n="12">XII. AND as bodily Health is thus gotten and ſuſtained by Virtue; ſo does Virtue confer Comlineſs and <hi>Decorum</hi> to all the Parts. For <hi>Beauty</hi> is but as the Fruit, or flower of Health, nay, 'tis very Health it ſelf; juſt as Virtue is the very health and beauty of the Soul. For where this preſides, the inward motion of the Spirits throws joy into the Countenance; and ſuch ſparkling through the Eyes, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders are drawn into love and admiration by it: Even the whole Body, when actuated by a beautiful Soul, is pleaſing in all its Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſaid, <hi>That a good Man could not conceal himſelf, if he did but open his Eyes; For his Benignity and Probity broke out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd him to all Beholders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. ON the contrary, we may eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Criſis when a Man is falling from his native Innocence or acquir'd Virtue, and is warping towards. Vice and Immorality; He carries a ſort of Traytor in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, who reveals all he is about. For tho the ſhape and colour of his Face may look the ſame to vulgar Eyes, yet a ſharper ſight will find a fading and declination in all the Finer Parts: that which once was freſh and florid, is now withering; that which ſparkled, is hardly bright: the Air it ſelf of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, made up of quick and congruous motions reſulting from every part, and as it were darting Life, is now ſtupid and irregular. Alas, thoſe inward Spirits, that ſupported all, are ſick, and their activity is but counterfeit!
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100094:135"/> So that, as now the whole contrivance of the Meen and Geſture is grown Artificial, it will in a ſhort time, become alſo Impudent. But this is not the Face of Virtue, or the Image of that <hi>Moral Beauty,</hi> we have hitherto ſet forth.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. FOR we alſo affirm, that thoſe, who are contending for Virtue, and who ſeriouſly aſpire to the purifi'd ſtate of the Mind; One may even in their Eyes and Aſpects behold a Light and Comlineſs growing on, as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libation of what they ſeek. Nay, where the Face is pale, and waſted by (perhaps) too fervent a purſuit of Virtue and true Wiſdom; Yet, even in ſuch paleneſs and Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Beholders ſee a certain Complacency and good Nature which is venerated by them. Wherefore, we conclude, no Man wants bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Decoration, where that of the Soul is not firſt wanting: for 'tis the Soul that governs thoſe Inward Spirits, on whoſe ſupply and regularity, all that is exterior depends.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. THUS far we have ſhewn, how much Virtue contributes to the getting of ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, as make either for the Mind, or for the Body. It now remains, to find what help ſhe gives in acquiring the good things that relate to Man, as he is compos'd of both: I mean, thoſe Accommodations of <hi>Liberty, Riches, Nobility, Friendſhip,</hi> and ſuch like. Now theſe being Things of that ſort, which are commonly call'd <hi>the Gifts of Fortune;</hi> we are not to expect, that they hold ſo cloſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100094:136"/> a Conjunction with Virtue, as what we have already mention'd. However that even theſe things alſo are by Virtue moſt eaſily acquirable, is no hard task to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. FIRST, As to <hi>Liberty,</hi> 'tis plain how every Nation ows to their Virtue and <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> that they are not over-run, but preſerv'd from the ſlavery of Invaders. And, even in the ſtate of Priſoners and Captives by War, how many Inſtances have we in the <hi>Roman</hi> Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that, for the <hi>Fidelity, Diligence,</hi> or <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> found in ſuch Captives, their Lords have afterwards made them Free. How much our <hi>Liberty</hi> is preſerv'd, by the obſervation of Laws and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> need no otherwiſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, than to obſerve, how Traytors to their King and Country, Thieves and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, are put in Chains, Condemn'd, and diſpatch'd.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. BUT ſhould a worthy Man, and for Virtue's ſake, be thrown into a Dungeon (which yet rarely happens) he muſt not be thought as totally depriv'd of <hi>Liberty.</hi> 'Tis true, if there were Power enough, to ſequeſter him from God and Virtue, this were ſufficient to make any Man tremble, and to make every Jail look horrid. But of this ſort none are capable but men of Impiety, and the Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. How vainly therefore do the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors menace the Virtuous, with a ſolitary, or even a naſty Jail? Can any Man, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and aſſiſted by the <hi>Divine Preſence,</hi> think
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100094:136"/> of his Ill Accommodation? Or he that has the Feaſt of a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> and the Miniſtration of all the Virtues attending him, think himſelf much alone?</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. AFTER all, ſeeing <hi>Liberty</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the power of Doing as you pleaſe: 'Tis plain, a good Man can be <hi>Free,</hi> whether in Priſon, or in Chains. For we affirm, that he evermore acts according to his own Will and Pleaſure, who has reſign'd both to the Divine Providence, and never wiſhes any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing may happen to him, but even that which happens. This conformity of the Mind, is highly expreſs'd by the Philoſopher <hi>Antoninus, O thou vaſt and Beautiful Univerſe, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 23.</note> created and ſupported by God, let every thing be delightful to me, that is pleaſing and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thy ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. As to the bearing of Honor: Who can imagine any one more qualifi'd for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Truſt, than the Honeſt Man? Are there not a whole train of Virtues, that both adorn and ſupport him? As, namely,
<list>
                        <item>Juſtice,</item>
                        <item>Magnanimity,</item>
                        <item>Faith,</item>
                        <item>Conſtancy,</item>
                        <item>Munificence,</item>
                        <item>Prudence,</item>
                        <item>Fortitude,</item>
                        <item>Vigilance:</item>
                        <item>And the like.</item>
                     </list> And is there any part of the World, where Men are choſen to Publick Office, but under theſe Characters? At leaſt under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Notion of ſuch: So as all the Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries, the Praiſes, and the Proſtrations, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100094:137"/> are pay'd them, come in on this Account. Now where (in truth) the Men are even quite otherwiſe: yet you may reckon them as the Statues and Images of good Men, and as adorn'd with their Names and Inſcriptions. And while Worſhip and Veneration is thus pay'd them, we may ſuppoſe, that thoſe good Men, whom they perſonate, receive it, as it happens in the caſe of abſent and inviſible Gods. So that no Man has more a Title to Honours, than the Man of <hi>Probity:</hi> For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, or his Repreſentative, is univerſally Honour'd by all Men.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. As to the gathering of <hi>Riches,</hi> you will ſay that a Man of <hi>Probity</hi> is out of his way. For that <hi>Fraud, Rapine,</hi> and <hi>Treachery, Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> or <hi>Breach of Truſt,</hi> and the like, do chiefly contribute to the <hi>Heaping</hi> of <hi>Wealth,</hi> and are the moſt compendious ways of procuring it. But we are of Opinion, 'tis a very fooliſh Bargain, to pay for any thing ten times more than 'tis worth: And we cannot but think, this is the Caſe, when a Man ſhall barter away his Virtue (even the ſmalleſt grains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) either for <hi>Wealth,</hi> or for <hi>High Place.</hi> There are, as we think, certain Gifts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by Virtue, which (doubtleſs) have power enough, to bring in <hi>Honeſt Plenty,</hi> and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Wealth:</hi> I mean, <hi>Diligence, Fidelity, Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, Temperance,</hi> and the like. It was <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s Exclamation, <hi>O wretched Man, that knows not what an Inheritance it is to be Frugal!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:100094:137"/>
                  <p n="21">XXI. As for the Attainment of <hi>Nobility:</hi> Whoever call'd in doubt, that there was any other Source thereof than Virtue? Or that <hi>Nobility,</hi> and Virtue, were not evermore the ſame? But of this, we have ſpoken more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. IN the laſt Place, as to all <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips;</hi> 'Tis viſible, how much they depend on Virtue: Since no Genuine <hi>Love,</hi> or ſincere <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> can be Cemented without it. The reſt is all Spurious; Whether it be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, in order to fordid Gain, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of Joy, that amuſe themſelves with light and tranſitory things.</p>
                  <p>'Tis Virtue alone that attracts and retains true <hi>Friendſhip: For</hi> (as <hi>Laelius</hi> ſpeaks Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly in <hi>Tully</hi>) <hi>She, when ſhe Exalts her ſelf, when ſhe expoſes her Light, when ſhe beholds and approves the ſame quality in others, ſhe moves preſently towards it; and, by a ſort of Coalition, joins to her ſelf that which was before in another: And that this is the true Generation of Love and Friendſhip.</hi> He farther adds, <hi>That Friendſhip is nothing elſe, but to Love without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Deſign.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, l.</hi> 1.</note> And (in his Book <hi>de Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ Deorum</hi>) he does a little adorn this Senſe, by theſe further words: <hi>If we turn our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to our own Profit, and not to his, whom we pretend to love; this will not be Friendſhip, but merely Traffick on our own Accounts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence 'tis plain, that there is not, in this Mortal State, a greater Bulwark than Virtue: for ſhe carries a Charm with her; drawing
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100094:138"/> Men on to Love and good Will: And then 'tis impoſſible, but all their Aſſiſtance, and good Offices, muſt attend us.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. YET here let us obſerve what comes to paſs about <hi>Truth:</hi> Which, tho it certainly makes one in Virtue's Quire; yet 'tis reputed a ſort of Foe to <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and as producing rather Hatred and Ill-will. But to me it has ever been a ſort of Riddle in Human Affairs, and deſerving laughter; to ſee how the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men hate the voice of that very <hi>Judge,</hi> unto whom however they perpetually ſeem willing to appeal.</p>
                  <p>Certainly no firm and durable <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> can ſubſiſt any more without <hi>Truth,</hi> than without <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> which are the Pillars of all true <hi>Friendſhip. Cicero</hi> ſays, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Double-minded, nor the Changeable Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer muſt be rely'd on for Fidelity.</hi> And let us add to theſe, the Men of Darkneſs and great Reſerve. He that does even moleſt his Friend with <hi>Truth,</hi> has leſs to anſwer for; than a flattering Paraſite, who is obſequious to every Vice, and can indulge, or abet his Friend to his utter deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>To Men of ſincere Virtue, this <hi>Truth</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comes amiſs: for every prudent Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that is not attended with Scoffs or Contumely, is a Sermon they hearken to with Wonder and Delight. For, as they grow better by it; ſo they have teſtimony of what is very Rare, namely, perfect <hi>Virtue,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> together.</p>

IT were eaſie for me, I confeſs, to be more copious, and dwell longer upon ſuch Particulars: But theſe Hints will be enough to inculcate, How much Virtue imports to the Acquiſition of all <hi>External Goods:</hi> And that, againſt the Changes and Chances of this Human Life, there is no other true Sanctuary but Virtue.</p>

THAT holy Vow and Profeſſion, which was made by <hi>Cato</hi> (in <hi>Tully</hi>'s Book <hi>de Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctute</hi>) has reſemblance with this very Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. <note place="margin">Cicero de Senectute.</note> For he ſays, <hi>I repent me not of having Liv'd, becauſe I have lived ſo, as never to have thought I was born in vain; and I depart this Life, not as from my Houſe, but as from an Inn. For Nature has not here afforded us an Habitation, but barely a reſting Place. O glorious Day, when I ſhall haſten to the great Aſſembly of bleſſed Souls, and be delivered from this Croud, and from that Dungeon, wherein I live!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:100094:139"/>
                  <p n="3">III. <note place="margin">De Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione.</note> THIS Opinion <hi>Cicero</hi> (in his Treatiſe <hi>de Conſolatione</hi>) repeats as his own, ſaying, <hi>I am none of thoſe, who believe the Soul can die with the Body; and that ſo great a Light, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Divine Nature in the Mind, can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd: but rather, that after ſome certain ſpace of time, it will return to Immortality.</hi> Now this by him is ſo expreſs'd, as if our preſent life were a ſort of a death to the Soul. And the ſame (in his <hi>Somnio Scipionis</hi>) is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly affirm'd by <hi>Africanus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De ſomnio Scipionis.</note> when <hi>Cornelius</hi> ask'd him, <hi>If his dead Friends ſhould live? Yes</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they truly live, who are extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the Chains of the Body, as from a Priſon: For your Life, as you ſo call it, is Death.</hi> Many are the paſſages of this Force, up and down, in <hi>Cicero:</hi> Not to ſpeak of what might be found in <hi>Plotinus</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. NOW inaſmuch as the hope of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, was ſo plain and conſpicuous of old, even to mere <hi>Pagans:</hi> How could we (poſſibly) exclude it from <hi>Moral Philoſophy?</hi> For by this it appears, that whatever external vexations innocent Virtue ſhall, in this Life, ſuffer (whether by hidden Fate, or by the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Envy, or Improbity of wicked Men) there will be a juſt and moſt infallible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for it. Wherefore the Good and the Magnanimous, being exalted by this Hope, look on the World with contempt: They trample upon inferiour things; and cannot regard any human Accidents as culpable, ſince nothing has regard to them, but what
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100094:140"/> is of Virtue and Immortality. 'Tis to this very Senſe, that <hi>Cicero</hi> does elſewhere magnifie the power of Virtue.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. SOCRATES is memorable for this ſame Confidence and Hope; ſince in the ſtrength thereof, he was enabled to undervalue both his Enemies and his Death. He, whom the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> pronounced the <hi>wiſeſt Man,</hi> would memorably in this deſerve that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. For, while he doubted of all other things, as to the Soul's Immortality he was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fix'd. So <hi>Laelius</hi> teſtifies of him (in <hi>Tully</hi>) <hi>That he was now of one Sentiment, and then of another, in moſt other things; Yet as to the Point of Immortality, he always affirm'd, That the Minds of Men were Divine; and that, as ſoon as they departed the Body, there was a moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious return of every juſt and vertuous Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. ON this Contemplation, let every Man therefore reſolve, that altho Virtue may (in ſome Caſes) appear to be againſt our Intereſt in reference to worldly things; yet are we to ſtand by it with an unſhaken Mind: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince, after this ſpan of Life is paſt, there will redound a vaſt reward and gratification to the Juſt. Nay, let us rather count, that what we ſuffer in Externals (as, ſuppoſe in Fortune or in Health) is rather to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: Since, if we make a wiſe uſe of our misfortunes, and underſtand them for kind Admonitions (as indeed they are) by how much we are diſappointed, or deſpoil'd, in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100094:140"/> outward Things; by ſo much, and more alſo, will the Mind be ſanctifi'd and enrich'd.</p>
                  <p>'Tis worth obſerving, that all Good, which is <hi>External,</hi> muſt fade and corrupt even as the Body it ſelf: while yet the <hi>Internal Things</hi> are as laſting as the Soul. So that to think, what we ſuffer in Body or Goods, to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment or Curſe, when we are likely to gain by it a more ample and perpetual Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; is a ſtrange Error in Accounts.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. NAY farther yet. If a Man had bought a thing at ten times leſs than the Value; Would it not ſound odd, to hear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that the bargain had undone him? Even ſo is it with the loſs of <hi>outward Things:</hi> Men murmure at Divine Providence, while yet they acquire ſuch improvement to the Soul thereby, as does not onely govern the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this Life, but guide us to a better, for all Eternity to come. Wherefore let no Man be too froward, when the croſſes and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this World come thick upon him; they are the Gifts and Bleſſings of a wiſe God, who beſt knows what Phyſick we need for the Health and Conduct of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Trials it is, that we can only find out the ſtrength and authority of Virtue: Theſe gratings rub off the ruſt and tarniſh of Vice: they ingender <hi>Prudence, Fortitude, Sincerity,</hi> and all other Virtues: at leaſt they detect our hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and ridiculous Pretences unto them. So that we will conclude, altho theſe Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may ſeem rude and bitter to the taſte, yet
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100094:141"/> in operation they are wholeſom, and produce Salutiferous effects.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. BUT now as to ſuch <hi>External Evils,</hi> which can no otherwiſe afflict the Mind, than by Imagination: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Enchiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion, c.</hi> 10.</note> Or elſe, as <hi>Epictetus</hi> has it, <hi>That things themſelves did not diſquiet Men, but their own falſe Opinions of things.</hi> I muſt needs aver, that Men thus afflicted merely by their <hi>Fancies,</hi> ſo as to make things intolerable, are but poor Proficients in Virtue: It deſerves not the name of Virtue, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. §. 18. <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. §. 16.</note> which is not able of it ſelf, to lay flat all imaginary Paſſions. 'Tis true, it may reaſonably be thought that there are ſome Sufferings above the force of Human Nature; ſuch as bodily Pains, which come by Sickneſs, that neither can be ſmother'd, nor diſſembled; And that ſome Tortures are ſo exquiſite, as to be beyond any conſtancy of the Mind to ſupport.</p>
                  <p>However, <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks Excellently hereof (as indeed of every thing elſe) He ſays, <hi>That Pain is a ſharp Adverſary to Virtue; <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tuſculan. Quaeſt. l.</hi> 5.</note> It menaces with burning Torches; It inſults over Fortitude and Magnanimity; and ventures to ſubdue even Patience it ſelf. But thus it would not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happen, if the fault were not our own: For Nature her ſelf, if rightly tutor'd and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, would prove a ſort of invincible Thing. But we alas (the more is our ſhame) have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected our Minds with Sloth, with Shadows, and Intemperance: Nay, we have ſo ſcribled over our Souls with Notions, and odd Opinions, that no room is left, for inſerting one ſound, or ſubſtantial Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:100094:141"/>
                  <p n="9">IX. HOWEVER we may obſerve, that 'tis not above the compaſs of Human Nature, to bear exceſſive Pains, when they are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertaken. We have ſtrange Examples what has been ſuffer'd for Glory, or by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom or Superſtition: Of which the very true Relations are almoſt incredible. As</p>
                  <p n="10">X. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tuſculan. Quaeſt. l.</hi> 2.</note> THAT of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Boys (which <hi>Tully</hi> mentions in his <hi>Tuſculane</hi>) who being brought to the Altar, could bear beating, not onely, till the blood guſh'd from their Bowels, but till they actually dy'd: And all this without Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or without a Groan.</p>
                  <p>That of the <hi>Indian Wives,</hi> who (being many to every <hi>Husband</hi>) have contended, even to the tearing off Hair, which of them ſhould go into the Fire alive, and burn with the dead Man.</p>
                  <p>That of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p>There are alſo, among the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,</hi> amazing Inſtances of ſpontaneous Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; Some on ſuperſtitious Accounts, and others for Oſtentation. And almoſt all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories do ſwarm with Examples of this kind.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. NOW, I ſay, if Nature, thus Rude, thus Illiterate, thus Barbarous and unprovided, thus inſenſible of true Virtue or of Excellent Things, could in patience and firmneſs of the Mind, ſo highly excel; What ſhould not true Virtue do? That Divine Thing, I mean, which holds Conjunction with God above;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100094:142"/> that is fortify'd with the ſplendid expectation of a bleſſed Immortality. Can, I ſay, this Champion ever give ground? Shall Virtue crouch, where even the barbarous have ſcorn'd to ſtoop? God forbid! And of Virtue, that is perfect and ſincere, let it never be ſaid! 'Tis true, there is a Nice Generation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Virtue; ſuch as keep up a general Acquaintance, and fain would be valu'd on the ſcore of ſome Familiarity with her: But if a Storm ariſe, or any Battels are to be fought on her account, they are preſently Men of another Climate, and their trueſt Religion is about Riches, Honour, and ſenſual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. NOW ſince we could prove by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Examples (if brevity were not in our Care) that 'tis not beyond the reach of a conſiderate Man, to overcome the greateſt difficulties: Let us bend our Souls to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring this true and perfect <hi>Patience.</hi> This is the Virtue, that ſubdues, and will enable us even to deſpiſe, as well the pleaſures of the Body, as all the ſorrows that can attend it. And let no Man fancy to himſelf, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to others, that he is poſſeſs'd of any Virtue at all, till he has attain'd that <hi>Patience,</hi> which we here ſet forth. For as bare Virtue is a high Reward, yet Happy Immortality is one of the certain Fruits thereof; So let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it immoveably, and let us never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we have it at all, unleſs we can hold it faſt.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:100094:142"/>
                  <p n="13">XIII. HERE ſome may contemptuouſly ask, Whether or no this our Philoſophy be the ſhorteſt way to be Happy? And whether theſe Rules are the method to enrich a Man's Family, or to make him a Magiſtrate? And whether this celebrated Virtue and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, do not rather conduct a Man to the Faggot, or to the Gallows; even as Examples, without Number, do teſtifie, in all Ages, and in every Climate?</p>
                  <p>To this we muſt take leave to Demur, by laying open the true Nature of Virtue. Which is not a thing calculated for peculiar Places and particular Seaſons; but has a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all Times, and to every Place, to procure us Felicity in both. It doth alſo, on the other hand, enable us either to reſiſt Evils; Or, if they prevail, to bear them with Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and reſignation.</p>
                  <p>How far Virtue contributes to the getting of <hi>Wealth, Honours,</hi> and the like, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Srct.</hi> 3. <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> has been already ſhewn. I will onely add that <hi>Honeſt Poverty</hi> is preferable to ill-gotten <hi>Riches:</hi> And ſuch (I take it) are manifeſtly ill-gotten and ill-kept, wher-ever Virtue has ſuffered for it, either in the whole, or in its ſmaller part. Wherefore let Virtue be your Children's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: if they have this, they will never ſtand in need of ſuperfluous Wealth; and if they have it not, you ought not to break your Heart to make them Rich.</p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:100094:143"/>
                  <p n="14">XIV. As to the Objection, For fear of Burning or the Gallows: take this for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if you want the Armor of <hi>Patience</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Tribulations and Temptations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that may happen, you then carry in your Boſom that Serpent <hi>Cowardiſe,</hi> which will urge you to betray your Prince, your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, your Friends, your Religion, and even all together, if it fairly comes in your way. Whereas if <hi>Patience,</hi> do but fortifie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate your Mind; it will embolden you to ſtand in defiance againſt thoſe mighty Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears. You may, in ſcorn of them, declare, that the Soul of Man is not to be ſcorch'd by Fire, nor choak'd by Water; nor can the Butchers chop it into parcels: That Virtue cannot, even by Violence, be torn from it, or God himſelf be ſeparated from Virtue and the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. BESIDES, this alſo may be reflected on, that our <hi>Life</hi> is but as a Thing depoſited with us by <hi>God.</hi> Now if <hi>God</hi> ſhall call for his own Pledge, How can we, with Senſe or Honeſty, refuſe ſo juſt and potent a Benefactor, or be unwilling to reſtore back what he lent? But this Pledge is always called for, as often as any Conditions for Life are made us, which cannot conſiſt with that Obſervance, which we owe to God and to Virtue.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. LASTLY, Let us take Comfort in this, That God is not uſually wanting to his Children, in their Extremities; that, if the Mind ſhall retain its Integrity and perſevere
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100094:143"/> to the laſt, 'tis ſcarce in the power of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to interrupt our Happineſs. <note place="margin">

She knows the Flames and Scourges of this World cannot disfigure her; For when their worſt is done, 'tis She finally ſhall Conquer; That ſhe, as a long Exile, is now ſolemnly recall'd to her Native Country: that She is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to the Region of bleſſed Souls; and even ſees them, as gazing upon her with joy, and as ſhouting with Acclamations at her approach.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. O the Joys! O the Triumphs! O what Embraces from that Illuſtrious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly! What Words, and Welcome, and Elogies, will they beſtow, for what ſhe ſo direfully ſuffer'd, and ſo bravely overcame, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Virtue and of Truth! How will the Manſions above Eccho and Rebound, with Hallelujah's of that Heavenly Quire! Or how rather, will this victorious Soul, enter with Triumph into thoſe Manſions, where Felicity is never to end! 'Tis in this Happy Station, where Love and Friendſhip are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Young, ſtill Unblemiſh'd, and evermore Sincere. Here Holy Angels, and all thoſe Reſplendent Beings, which are above, do not onely behold the Beauties of each other, but Communicate, and even Diſcourſe, by ſome unſpeakable Way: But this is ſure, that Truth ſhines out in its utmoſt Purity, and Virtue is bright and manifeſt in all they ſay. Beſides,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100094:144"/> here are no Viciſſitudes, all is Peace, all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and all things are Stationary and fix'd. In ſhort, here is a Conſummation of the Soul's bleſs'd Eſtate; And it were impoſſible to find it elſewhere.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. AND how could this otherwiſe be, ſince the Mind of Man is as the Image of God, drawn and deſcending from him. And being drawn from God; it covets Heaven, as deſirous to return from whence it came. All Inclinations towards the Earth ſavour of the Body; But as to the Soul, her Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is above, and her true Country is Heaven. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> Diſcourſes wiſely of this Matter, <hi>There can no Origination of the Soul be found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</hi>

HERE, we confeſs, are great things ſpoken; and ſo perhaps through this whole Work: Yet we ſuppoſe they are not greater, than what belongs to the true and genuine Deſcription of <hi>Moral Philoſophy.</hi> They are not beyond the Compaſs and Meaning of <hi>Right Reaſon;</hi> nor exceed the Profeſſions and Memorials of the moſt Excellent of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>

                  <p n="21">XXI. HOWEVER, That Religion may not be defrauded of her due Honour, I do here alſo profeſs, teſtifie, and declare, that I think nothing is found in the Writings of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, or commemorated as the Deeds and Sayings of Renowned <hi>Heathens;</hi> But all their Flights and Raptures (whether about <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Soul,</hi> or <hi>Virtue</hi>) are owing, either to the very Doctrine, or to the Ancient <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala</hi> or Tradition of the moſt Primitive Church of God, Or elſe to the <hi>Eternal</hi> Son, that <hi>Logos,</hi> or WORD <hi>of God;</hi> Who has, in all Ages paſt, endow'd every Man with ſome Senſe of <hi>Honeſty;</hi> Tho ſome Men have always been more <hi>Burning,</hi> and more <hi>Shining Lights,</hi> than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>For this WORD is that <hi>True Light,</hi> which <hi>Enlightneth all Men that come into this World:</hi> even as the <hi>Scripture</hi> has it. Now that <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> drew his Knowledg from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Fountains, is what all Writers, Sacred and Prophane, do teſtifie and aver. That <hi>Plato</hi> took from him the principal part of that Knowledg, touching <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Soul's Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>the Conduct of Life and Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> has been doubted by no Man. And that it went from him, into the Schools of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and ſo deriv'd and diffus'd, almoſt into the whole World, is in like manner at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by all.</p>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100094:145"/> Power and Benignity of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the extent of its Gifts: So can theſe Men, in no degree, either obſcure, or derogate from, the Glory of the <hi>Church.</hi> For they, as we ſaid, did but borrow their precious Things, either from the <hi>Church</hi> of God, or from the <hi>Divine Logos</hi> or <hi>WORD.</hi> That <hi>Word</hi> which the old Church (I mean that of the <hi>Jews</hi>) did worſhip when it ſhined from the Tabernacle: and which the New Church (I mean that of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) ſtill adores in the Human Nature of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as in the glorious Temple of its Reſidence. <hi>And may it be Worſhipped and Adored for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
